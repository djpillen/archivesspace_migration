    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Janice Michael and Neubecker are Newport, Michigan residents. Michael Neubecker grew up Catholic in greater Detroit area and graduated from the Wayne State University.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, two of Neubeckers' gay family members and Janice's former teacher fell victims of hate crimes; another gay family member was physically assaulted. In 1991, their son William (Lee), at the time a freshman in college, was not able to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at Eastern Michigan University because of the military's policy at the time of not accepting openly gay troops. Michael and Janice supported Lee in his public protest.</p>
      <p>In 1995 the Neubeckers started coming to local Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) meetings, the organization for parents, families, friends, and straight allies united with people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. They were inspired to join PFLAG-Detroit after hearing then-national president Mitzi Henderson speak at the 1995 Human Rights Campaign dinner event at the Fox Theatre. Only 6 months later, in 1996, Michael and Janice founded PFLAG Downriver. Michael and Janice scheduled the first monthly PFLAG Downriver meeting in their basement in June of 1996. In September of 1996 the meetings moved to the Southgate church location. A Steering Committee was formed to formalize the FLAG/Downriver chapter and prepare bylaws and affiliation papers. The chapter received their affiliation papers in October of 1996. They became a chartered chapter in the fall of 1997. Michael was the first PFLAG Downriver President and served for two years. Janice followed as President and has served several years followed by Maryan Mackie who served for two years, then Michael returned to his role as President again. He also was the chapter newsletter editor. PFLAG provided a venue for parents and family members of LGBT teenagers and adult children, enabling them to learn more about being a positive parent or family member of an LGBT person, find common ground with other parents and learn how to be there for the gay person in their life. The chapter took active part in state, regional, and national PFLAG campaigns and petitions, and local events.</p>
      <p>In 1998, with support of the PFLAG Downriver Board, the Neubeckers started a Straight Spouses group dedicated to helping straight persons to understand and accept their LGBT spouses. The group became an outreach of the PFLAG Downriver chapter.</p>
      <p>In April 2004 Michael Neubecker was elected to fill a midterm vacancy on the PFLAG's national Board of Directors, only six months after he was voted Director of PFLAG's Great Lakes Region (Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and later Illinois). As Regional Director, Neubecker represented the concerns of local chapters in these three states to the national organization, communicated with chapters about national programs and goals, and acted as a facilitator between chapters to resolve any problems or disputes in the organization.</p>
      <p>After a 2012 house fire, Neubeckers moved to Newport, Mich. PFLAG Downriver members continued to meet until January 2013 but were not able to find effective leadership to run the chapter, after which the PFLAG Downriver chapter disbanded. Members continue to attend other local PFLAG chapters meetings.</p>
      <p>Neubecker's son Lee is married to David who changed his last name to Neubecker and together in 2009 they have adopted two children from the foster care system in the Chicago area. These children have been in their home since 2007 and are brother and sister. In February 2013 PFLAG National filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs in the landmark Perry v. Hollingsworth case. The case challenged the constitutionality of the discriminatory "Proposition 8" legislation in California that eliminated the right for same-sex couples to marry. The brief shared the stories of PFLAG families and the very real impact that their lack of equal protection under the law has on their families. The Neubecker family story was among the stories presented to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>Neubeckers personally lobbied their elected representative on their concerns for equality for the LGBT community. Michael Neubecker is member of Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN)/Detroit and PFLAG liaison, member of Triangle Foundation Board of Advisors, and American Friends Services Committee non-violent training and dialogues participant. Neubeckers are Human Rights Campaign Federal Club members and supporters. They are also active in the Reconciling Congregations Movement to remove barriers to LGBT persons in the United Methodist Church. Michael is the First United Methodist Church of Flat Rock--Reconciling member, lay speaker and choir member.</p>
      <p>Among their numerous awards, the Neubeckers received the Pride Award for Community Service in 1997, the Spirit of Detroit Award in 1999, the Pride Partnership Award from the Triangle Foundation in 2000, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Human Rights Campaign in 2001, and the 2002 Motor City Pride Award, among others.</p>
      <p>Michael Neubecker is the author of the 1995 book "Out of the Closet Into Our Hearts," and is an occasional contributor to <title render="italic">Between the Lines</title>, a periodical published by Pride Source Media Group, LLC. based in Livonia, Mich. He has been a talk-radio guest on WXYT, WJR, and WMUZ in Detroit. Together Neubeckers have represented PFLAG on six cable programs in the Downriver area.</p>
      <p>Michael Neubecker also performs as a stand-up comedian. His comedy is rooted in his family experience and his time spent working with PFLAG. A good chunk of his routine is about having an openly gay son, and his humorous message is intended primarily for parents of gay children.</p>

          <p>The Subject Files series (1.1 linear feet) includes notes and memoranda, collected articles, pamphlets, flyers, newspaper clippings, and other material related to topics of interest and activism. Hate Crimes, Religion, and Safe Schools are among the most developed subjects in this series. Hate Crimes files include the Triangle Foundation's reports, correspondence, memoranda, petitions, and other anti-hate crimes campaign materials; collected pamphlets, and 1997 report and guide for communities by the Michigan Civil Rights Commission's Bias Crime Response Task Force. Among files dedicated to Religion is a folder with drafts of sermons written and delivered by Michael Neubecker; also included here collected material related to religious teachings and homosexuality, specifically the Catholic Church and "ex-gay" ministries; also collected materials of reconciling congregations. Material related to church and homosexuality also can be found in the Homophobia folder. The Safe Schools files contain reports and newspaper coverage of administrative discrimination and violence against gay students in Michigan, the State Board of Education debate on the subject, and PFLAG Safe Schools Campaign material. Also present in the series is a large file containing collected material of out-of-state gay rights and human rights organizations on various subjects.</p>
