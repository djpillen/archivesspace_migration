    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Frank Caleb Gates was born September 12, 1887 in Ravenswood, Illinois. He was a lifelong student and teacher of science, primarily interested in botany, ecology and biology. He developed his interest in science at an early age and was able to expand his knowledge through the use of libraries close to his suburban Chicago home. He completed his undergraduate education at the University of Illinois in 1910, majoring in botany. He continued his graduate and doctoral studies at the University of Michigan, receiving his Ph.D. in Botany in 1912. Gates departed for a faculty position at the University of the Philippines in 1912 where he remained until 1915. During this time Gates documented, through photographs and writings, his observations of the diverse vegetation, geography and climate of that region as well as the culture of its people and the students he taught. He made several excursions to the outlying Filipino countryside that are also well-documented. Gates returned home from the Philippines by way of Japan, China, Hawaii and the Western United States.</p>
      <p>Upon his return he married Margaret (Madge) Murray Thompson in Cleveland, Ohio on June 11, 1915. Madge and Frank were neighbors while growing up in Ravenswood, Illinois and the two corresponded frequently throughout Mr. Gates time in the Philippines. Between the years 1915 and 1918 Mr. Gates taught botany and biology at the University of Michigan Biological Station during the summer and at Carthage College in Carthage, Illinois during the regular school term. Mr. Gates moved on to teach for many years at Kansas State College. The Gates adopted two children, David M. and Margaret Elizabeth. Frank Gates died in 1955.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series consists of four subseries (photograph albums, negatives, lantern slides, and postcards) containing visual documentation of Mr. Gates' stay in the Philippines as well as his lengthy journey home through Japan, China, the Hawaiian Islands and the Western United States. The seven albums created by Mr. Gates (and his contemporaries at the University of the Philippines) capture the images of his journey, primarily the vegetation found on the Philippine Islands. He has assigned a number to each image. These numbers correspond to the negatives also contained in this series. The negatives are contained in 105 envelopes and arranged numerically in the box. It is important to note that in this box, there are additional negatives whose original photograph is not contained in the albums. These negatives cover the years immediately following Mr. Gates return from the Philippines. This series also contains a small box of lantern slides produced from select negatives from the Philippines trip, as well as slides used by Mr. Gates in academic course instruction (at the University of Michigan Biological Station among other institutions). The final material in this series consists of a box of postcards collected throughout Mr. Gates' stay in the Philippines and on his voyage home through Japan and China.</p>
