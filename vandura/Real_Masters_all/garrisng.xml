      <p>Garnet R. Garrison was born in Warrick County, Indiana in 1911. He received his B.A. from Wayne State University in 1933, and his M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1936. He married Isabelle M. Schelbe, also a WSU graduate. They have one daughter.</p>
      <p>Garrison's career in broadcasting began during his student days at WSU when he worked as an announcer at Detroit area radio stations WEXL (1931) and WMBC (1932-1933). While working on his M.A. at the University of Michigan (1933-36), Garrison also worked as free lance announcer-director and newscaster at WXYZ, Detroit, and the Michigan Radio Network (1933-1934). He later joined the staff at radio station WJIM, Lansing as program director, copy writer, and political commentator (1934-1936).</p>
      <p>In 1936, Garrison returned to Wayne State University as a lecturer in the Department of Speech. He taught the first courses in broadcasting at this institution, and also served as director of radio. He founded the WSU Broadcasting Guild. Garrison pioneered in the development of a system of audience measurement utilizing diaries, a technique which he continued to research and which became widely used in both radio and television.</p>
      <p>During his time on the WSU staff Garrison continued graduate work at the University of Michigan, working on a Ph.D. in education, until his move to the National Broadcasting Company in New York City. During his years at NBC (1942-1947), he covered news and political events, produced several documentaries, and produced and directed many drama programs. He also taught broadcasting courses as a lecturer for Columbia University.</p>
      <p>Garrison joined the Speech Department of the University of Michigan as a lecturer in 1947, was appointed associate professor in 1948, and professor in 1950 at which time he also became director of the newly founded Television Center. Under Garrison's direction, the University pioneered in the production and direction of educational TV programs. For several years, the TVC worked in cooperation with station WWJ-TV in Detroit. UM faculty would participate in television programs which were prepared and rehearsed on campus, and then props, scripts, staff, and faculty were transported to Detroit for the live production at WWJ studios. In 1951 stations WJIM (Lansing) and WKZO (Kalamazoo) began simultaneous broadcast of the live WWJ programs via a microwave relay hookup.</p>
      <p>Station WOOD (Grand Rapids) began its own cooperative effort with the TVC in 1952 with the multi-part series "Understanding Our World." These programs were developed and rehearsed at the UM campus and then broadcast live from WOOD studios.</p>
      <p>In 1953 WPAG, the UHF station in Ann Arbor, requested programming. The TVC provided studio facilities, equipment, and technical assistance, and the UM Speech Department provided student staff as part of its television production courses. Approximately 340 programs were broadcast from 1953 to 1957 when WPAG went off the air.</p>
      <p>"Understanding Our World" (originally created for station WOOD) was continued in production by the TVC. UM faculty, and later, local, national, and international personalities, were featured. The format of the programs included interviews, panel discussions, demonstrations, and documentaries, and covered a wide variety of subjects.</p>
      <p>The Television Center was also active in co-development with many academic areas of the university in the uses of instruction via closed- circuit television with particular emphasis in the Medical and Law Schools. The TVC documented the life of the university on film: physical changes on campus as new buildings were erected; ceremonies and celebrations involving faculty, students, and distinguished guests; and everyday student life and activities. The TVC also produced a number of films for public relations and educational purposes.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the TV Center has received many television and film awards. The first came in 1955 from <title render="italic">Variety</title>, which gave the TVC the only Show-Management Plaque ever awarded an educational institution. Many national awards were also received by the stations WUOM and WVGR, and many series were produced for the national listening audience through the National Educational Radio Network.</p>
      <p>Garrison was named director of broadcasting in 1958. His responsibilities expanded to include UM radio as well as television. Prior to this appointment, the two areas had operated independently with separate directors.</p>
      <p>In 1972, Garrison relinquished the administrative post of director of broadcasting to resume fulltime teaching. He continued teaching until his retirement in 1979. Garrison was named professor emeritus of speech communication and theatre in recognition of his long and distinguished career as teacher, administrator, and broadcaster at the University.</p>
      <p>Garrison was co-author (with Giraud Chester, NYC) of the textbook <title render="italic">Radio and Television</title>, published in 1950. This work was extensively revised in 1956 and published under the new title, <title render="italic">Television and Radio</title>. A third edition was published in 1963, co-authored with Giraud Chester and Edgar Willis (UM Speech Department). The fifth and last edition was published in 1978. This textbook was widely used by colleges and universities around the U.S.</p>
      <p>Garrison wrote a number of articles and papers on listener diary techniques, broadcast techniques, and ongoing work in TV at the UM. He appeared on the programs of many regional and national speech and broadcasting conventions and seminars. Garrison was listed in <title render="italic">Who's Who in America</title> for several years during the 50's and 60's.</p>
      <p>Garrison served on the Executive Council of the Speech Association of America and as a member of the Professional Advancement Committee of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. He was also a member of the Michigan Association of Speech, the Educational Theatre Association, and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). He served as the chairman of the Communication Arts Committee of the Michigan State Council for the Arts, (1966-1967). He belongs to the honorary fraternities Delta Sigma Rho (Speech), Phi Delta Kappa (Education), Pi Kappa Delta (Speech), and Phi Kappa Phi (Scholarship).</p>
      <p>Following his retirement from the university, Garrison collaborated with Professor Alfred Slote (one-time student, faculty colleague, producer-writer at the UM Television Center, and longtime friend) in writing two mysteries <title render="italic">Santa Claus Killer</title> and <title render="italic">Maze</title>. These were written under the pen name of A.H. Garnet (A.H. from collaborator Alfred H. Slote). <title render="italic">Santa Claus Killer</title> was published in 1981, and <title render="italic">Maze</title> in 1982. The U.S. publisher was Ticknor and Fields, and the London publisher was Victor Gollancz Ltd.</p>

            <p>The National Broadcasting Company, NYC file is largely composed of newspaper clippings and publicity releases in the period 1942-1947. Garrison joined the National Broadcasting Company as director of the Employee Program Training Group. He later became production manager in charge of Drama, NBC Eastern Division. He directed several hundred radio dramas and documentaries, including "Home is What You Make It," (a public service series which won favorable recognition in John Crosby's column in <title render="italic">Variety</title>); "Words at War," (serious drama); "Archie Andrews," (situation comedy); "Grantland Rice Sports Stories," (action plays); and "Milestones on the Road to Peace," (two special one- hour documentaries, "VE and VJ Day"). In 1946-1947, Garrison also taught broadcasting courses as a lecturer for Columbia University. The classes were held at the NBC studios.</p>

The reports document progress in both radio and television, and those areas which Garrison wished to adapt and develop further. Other files - "GRG Scholarship Fund," "Sabbatical Leave," and "Retirement" - round out GRG's long and distinguished career. Correspondence and memorabilia demonstrate the long-lasting influence and impact he had among his many friends and colleagues.</p>

          <p>The series - Writings, speeches, and scripts -- documents Garrison's creative life. The subseries, Published Mysteries, is subdivided into two sections: correspondence, newspaper clippings, and publicity releases relating to <title render="italic">Santa Claus Killer</title>, and materials which relate to <title render="italic">Maze</title>. These books were written post-retirement, and in collaboration with Professor Alfred Slote. There are two audio cassettes and a 7 1/2" reel-to-reel tape of radio interviews with Garrison and Professor Slote in the Audio-Visual series. Other portion of this series include Speeches, Scripts, and Printed Materials. These were collected throughout Garrison's career. "Milestones on the Road to Peace" was a major two- part documentary written and directed by GRG while at NBC. The collection contains audio cassettes of this program. The "Inspector General" script was a TV adaptation by John Rich, UM alumnus. Among the Printed Materials are a copy of the textbook <title render="italic">Radio and Television</title>, materials from Garrison's early days at WSU, and a dissertation written by James Lynch, UM student.</p>
