      <p>The Cromwell collection consists of ca. 570 original editorial cartoons intended for publication in the <title render="italic">Detroit Times</title>. The subjects of the cartoons are primarily Detroit and Michigan politics, government, and public issues. The topics are a reflection of the times: the automobile, traffic problems, gasoline prices, the impact of the Ku Klux Klan in local elections, prohibition, public transportation, and crime and law enforcement. Many of the cartoons concern the public personalities of the time: Mayor Frank Murphy, Henry Ford, Governor Alexander Groesbeck, Ty Cobb. The cartoons range in size from 14 1/2" x 11 1/2" to 14 1/2" x 20".</p>
