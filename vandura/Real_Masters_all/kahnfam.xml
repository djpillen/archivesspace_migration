      <p>As America's most influential industrial architect, Albert Kahn revolutionized the health and safety conditions of early twentieth-century factories and worked closely with Henry Ford to implement his vision of the assembly line at the Highland Park and River Rouge automobile plants. Kahn pioneered the use of reinforced concrete, non-intrusive steel structures, natural ventilation and glass building skins to respond to the changing functional needs of the American factory. His pragmatism, ability to listen to the needs of the client and experimentation with innovative building technologies resulted in a new industrial architecture, which inspired the development of European Modernism by Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. Hugely versatile in his design capabilities and strongly interested in historic architecture, Kahn also produced many commercial and institutional icons in Detroit and at the University of Michigan, including the Fisher Building, Detroit Athletic Club, General Motors Building, Hill Auditorium, Angell Hall, William L. Clements Library and Burton Memorial Carillon Tower. This most prolific of American architects built over 2000 projects in his lifetime, including 521 factories in Russia between 1929 and 1932, and in 1938 was constructing 19% of all architect-designed industrial facilities in the United States. When he died in 1942, he had signed defense contracts totaling $200 million for the construction of the Willow Run Bomber Plant and naval bases in Honolulu, Midway Island, Puerto Rico and Kodak, Alaska, among other war-time facilities.</p>
      <p>In 1896, Kahn married Ernestine Krolik, the daughter of Adolph Krolik, who was a successful dry goods merchant and a client of the young architect. A graduate of the University of Michigan in 1892, Ernestine was a talented gardener and interior designer, who often advised Albert on matters of color and fabric selection. When speaking of her parents, their daughter Rosalie Kahn Butzel said years later that "they complemented each other wonderfully."[1] Albert and Ernestine had two other daughters, Lydia and Ruth, and one son, Edgar (1900-1985). "Eddie" became the first scorer and captain of the University of Michigan hockey team, graduating from the University Medical School in 1924. From 1949 to 1971, he served as the Chairman of Neurosurgery at the University of Michigan Hospital (designed by his father in 1919).</p>

      <p>The Kahn Family papers have come to the library from two sources: from Carol Kahn, the granddaughter of Albert and Ernestine Kahn, and from William R. Brashear, a biographer of Albert Kahn. The Albert Kahn Family Papers received from Carol Kahn includes letters, miscellaneous materials and photographs which contribute to our understanding of Kahn’s relationship with his wife and children. The materials illuminate the personal side of Kahn’s life and document the distinguished military and professional careers of his son Edgar (1900-1985), who served as Chairman of Neurosurgery at the University of Michigan Hospital from 1949 to 1971. The papers received from William R. Brashear include papers of Ruth Kahn Rothman and Edward E. Rothman.</p>

          <p>The Albert Kahn Family Papers received from Carol Kahn encompass three subseries, Correspondence, Miscellaneous Papers and Photographs and Audio-Visual Materials.</p>
        </scopecontent>
        <c02 level="subseries">
          <did>
            <unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle>
          </did>
          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Correspondence subseries includes letters to and from Albert Kahn, his wife Ernestine Krolik Kahn, his son Edgar Adolph Kahn and his granddaughter Carol Kahn. While the letters from Albert number only four, researchers will find his letter to his sister-in-law Amy of 11/9/1900 to be of particular interest. In this hand-written piece of correspondence, Kahn recounts his delight in visiting Paris, Genoa, and Florence in 1891 and includes a sketch of an Italian arch. He also expresses pride and delight in his baby son, Edgar. Two late letters of 6/26/1940 and 7/17/1942 to Edgar, who was posted for military duty in Spain and Little Rock, Arkansas, are also significant. In these documents, Kahn describes his own war defense work and expresses concern for his son's welfare. He gives us a glimpse of paternal emotion when he ends the 1940 letter with these words to Eddie: "You mean everything to all of us." The four letters to Kahn in this series include two from his brother Julius (one dated 1/14/1900), with whom he collaborated on the use of reinforced concrete in structural design. Also included is a letter from his first partner Alexander Buel Trowbridge (10/17/1898), who had recently become the dean of the Cornell University College of Architecture.</p>
            <p>Within the Correspondence subseries, the letters written by Kahn's future wife Ernestine Krolik at the age of 16 give researchers a view of the personality of this intelligent, young woman, who shows herself to be cultured, confident and family-oriented. Twenty-one letters were written by Ernestine during her summer visit in St. Paul, Minnesota from 6/29/1885 to 9/1/1885. They were addressed to her mother, sister Bell, brother Day and father Adolph Krolik, a dry goods merchant who would later become a client of Albert Kahn. In addition to her descriptions of her train trips to such tourist destinations as Lake Johanna, White Bear Lake and Lake St. Croix, she provides detailed walking-tour portraits of the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis in 1885. Of particular note is Ernestine's letter of 7/25/1885 to her mother, in which she describes her meeting of "a Mr. Kahn," who accompanied her and her German friend Emma to the Tivoli beer garden. Her description of his personal appearance and some of his rather indelicate remarks is hilarious. Her letters show her to have a game sense of adventure, as well as a strong devotion to her parents, whose "kindness and warm-heartedness" she praises. Included in the letters to Ernestine is a 1942 Western Union telegram from V. A. Vernin, Russian Architect-Academician, expressing "sympathy in connection with the death of your husband Mr. Albert Kahn, who rendered us great service in designing a number of large plants and helped us to assimilate the American experience in the sphere of [the] building industry."</p>
            <p>Kahn's son Edgar's letters to his colleague and mentor Dr. Max M. Peet, in the Neurosurgery Department at the University of Michigan, describe his further medical training in London in 1936 and his military service at Kennedy General Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, as World War II came to an end. Peet's letters to Edgar in 1942 and 1945 give researchers a view of the changes and challenges at University Hospital during the war years. Letters from other physicians document Edgar Kahn's stature in the field of neurosurgery.</p>

            <p>The second subseries, Miscellaneous Papers, includes documents which illuminate aspects of family members' professional and personal lives. A Kahn family tree is included to give researchers an understanding of the legacy of Albert and Ernestine Kahn, as well as that of Kahn's brothers and sisters, Julius, Felix, Louis, Gus, Moritz, Mollie and Paula. Ernestine's school certificates document her graduation from Detroit High School in 1887, before she entered the University of Michigan. A small number of newspaper articles about Edgar Kahn illuminates aspects of his hockey prowess at the University of Michigan in the early 1920s, his distinguished military service and his medical career as Chairman of Neurosurgery at University Hospital. Carol Kahn's files of newspaper articles, letters and photographs describe the efforts of a group of citizens to "Save Old Main," University Hospital which Albert Kahn designed and built in 1921. Carol was active in this 1989 preservation campaign which succeeded in saving the entry arch of her grandfather's historic hospital.</p>

            <p>The third subseries, Photographs, is arranged chronologically and comprised of images from Ernestine's childhood in the 1870s to her granddaughter Carol Kahn's Ontario canoe trip in 1989. Five photographs depict Albert's and Ernestine's children between 1901 and 1908, and three images show Albert and Ernestine together in their later years. The preponderance of photographs in the collection are of Edgar during his youth, his school years at Andover and the University of Michigan, his European travels, and his medical career in the neurosurgical operating room. These often intimate glimpses of the Kahns in various states of relaxation are significant in providing researchers with a sense of the strong relationships which have bound together the family of the master of American industrial architecture.</p>

        <p>The Albert Kahn Papers, donated by his firm Albert Kahn Associates, Inc. in 2003, include correspondence, transcripts of speeches, newspaper articles and construction photographs of many of Kahn's most significant buildings. In addition, original, ink-on-linen construction drawings of selected industrial, commercial, institutional and residential projects are part of the Bentley's Albert Kahn collection. The narrative and visual documents in this large collection give researchers the opportunity to study many aspects of the master architect's career and life, from his personal views on industrial architecture contained in his speeches, to the drawings which preserve his icon buildings for posterity on paper. The finding aid for the Albert Kahn Papers is available in hard copy in the reading room of the library and on the Bentley website: http://www.umich.edu/~bhl/EAD/eadlist3.htm</p>
