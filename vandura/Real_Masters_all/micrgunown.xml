      <p>Formed in 1996 by only eight concealed pistol advocates in the successful fight to implement "shall-issue" concealed carry in Michigan, the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners (MCRGO) is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to "promot[e] safe use and ownership of firearms through education, litigation and legislation" (http://mcrgo.org/about-mcrgo/ accessed in September 2015). As of 2015 it has paid full time staff and is Michigan's largest, non-profit, state-based firearms organization.</p>
      <p>In addition to assisting allied groups including Students for Concealed Carry, Michigan Open Carry, and Michigan Gun Owners, the MCRGO is actively involved with firearms-related legislation in Michigan, and were active in the concealed carry reform law of 2000 and the revisions to it that were passed in 2002. They maintain a Political Action Committee registered with the Bureau of Elections of the State of Michigan which has helped many pro-firearm legislators in state-wide elections.</p>
      <p>Board members of MCRGO are elected from the membership, and membership dues support MCRGO activities, including the distribution of information though traditional media including guest editorials in local Michigan newspapers, town-hall meetings interviews on radio and television and participation in community forums and local government meetings. They also issue a quarterly newsletter entitled "On Point," which provides detailed background on MCRGO's current work on efforts such as strengthening preemption laws, eliminating no carry zones, ending the practice of granting special firearms rights to special groups, and promoting firearms recreation including both hunting and sport, as well as interviews with prominent gun rights activists. </p>
      <p>The MCRGO has a charitable arm, the MCRGO Foundation. The Foundation has a 501(C)(3) status, and its mission is to educate the public on the Second Amendment, Michigan's Constitutional Right to Bear Arms, and the safe ownership and usage of firearms. A volunteer board of directors administers the Foundation. Board members are selected for their knowledge, experience, and commitment to fostering the intent and goals of the Foundation mission.</p>
