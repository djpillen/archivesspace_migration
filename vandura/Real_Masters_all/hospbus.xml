      <p>The University Hospital began when a professor's home was converted into a small, 20 bed hospital in 1869, which was expanded to 60 beds in 1875. This facility was replaced by the Catherine Street Hospital, which opened in 1891. The Psychopathic Hospital was funded by the state in 1901 and completed in 1906. The state maintained the building until it was turned over to the university in 1937. The Catherine Street Hospital became overcrowded, so the Regents approved the construction of a new building in 1915, University Hospital, which was completed in 1923. The building, also called "Old Main," was replaced by the new University Hospital and A. Alfred Taubman Health Care Center in 1986 as the primary University of Michigan Hospital.</p>
      <p>The following is a timeline of key dates in the history and development of the University of Michigan Hospitals (and later Health System). A more detailed history of the hospital from its inception through 1940 is available in <title render="italic">The University of Michigan An Encyclopedic History</title> (Volume II).</p>

          <p>Accountant's Daily Reports (3 linear feet, 1926-1973) is comprised of reports by the accountants summarizing the financial status of the hospital. For each day, they recorded accounts receivable, statistics on the number of patients, cash and revenue. They also listed the cumulative statistics for the year, and the comparable amount for a year and two years prior. Starting in fiscal year 1948/49, a report was only created on the 10th, 20th, and last day of each month. Reports are not included for the following fiscal years: 1932/33, 1933/34, 1934/35, 1938/39, and 1940/41.</p>
          <p>Beginning in fiscal year 1941/42, patient statistics were listed separately for each hospital. There is the University Hospital or General Division, and also the Neuropsychiatric Institute (1941-1966), Veterans Readjustment Center (1947-1963), Children's Psychiatric Hospital (1955-1966), Clinical Research Unit (1963-1971), and Psychiatric Division (1966-1971). Patient statistics were no longer included in the Accountant's Daily Reports after January 20, 1971.</p>

          <p>Director's Daily Statistical Reports [RESTRICTED] (5 linear feet, 1947-1977) contains statistical reports on the patients of the university hospitals. For each day, they record the number of patients at each location and the percent occupancy of each division, as well as a record of individuals who died or were dangerously ill that day. The report indicates their name, location, the service the patient was receiving, the doctor who recorded the information, and the hometown of the patient. Some of the reports also include the number of patients receiving each service (1948-1960) and the number of registrations by service (1948-1963). Because of the presence of patient names, the reports in this series are restricted.</p>
