    <subfield code="b">European approaches to education and research held strong appeal for Barritt. In the first of four sabbatical leaves to study abroad, he spent the early months of 1970 as a visiting scholar at the Institute for the Scientific Study of Education at the University of Geneva, where he attended lectures by Jean Piaget. Barritt spent the 1973-74 academic year as a Senior Fulbright Lecturer at the University of Utrecht.</subfield>

    <subfield code="b">Back at the University of Michigan in 1974, Barritt established the Phenomenology Seminar, which in 1981 was renamed the Human Science Research Association meeting. The seminar brought together scholars interested in phenomenological approaches to educational research, which concentrates on a dialogue between study subjects and researchers and encourages participation in the lives of the subjects.</subfield>
