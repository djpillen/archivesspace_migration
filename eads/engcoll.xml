      <p>The Department of Engineering was established at the University of Michigan in 1858, four years after engineering courses were first offered. In 1871 Professor DeVolson Wood suggested that the Department of Engineering be separated from the Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts, but it was not until 1895 that such a separation occurred. In that year, the departments of civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering were organized into a distinct Department of Engineering and Professor Charles Ezra Greene was appointed dean. The department was to be governed by the faculty, with the dean handling admission of students. Mortimer Elwyn Cooley, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University since 1881, was appointed dean upon Greene's death in 1903 and took office in 1904. He served as dean until 1928 and was succeeded by Herbert Charles Sadler, a professor of naval architecture and marine engineering who had been on the University of Michigan faculty for thirty-nine years. Sadler resigned the deanship in 1937 and was followed by Henry Clay Anderson, a professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Anderson died in 1939 and was replaced by Ivan Charles Crawford, a civil engineer who had served as dean of the colleges of engineering at the University of Idaho and the University of Kansas. He was dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan from 1940 to 1951. The sixth dean of the college, George Granger Brown, held the post from 1951 to 1957. He was followed by Stephen S. Attwood, 1957-1965, Gordon Van Wylen, 1965-1972, and David V. Ragone, 1972-1980. Hansford W. Farris served as acting dean from 1980 until the 1981 appointment of James J. Duderstadt. Duderstadt resigned in 1986 to become provost and vice president for academic affairs for the university. He was succeeded as dean by Charles M. Vest, 1986-1989. Daniel E. Atkins, III, was interim dean from 1989 to 1990, Peter M. Banks served as dean from 1990 to 1996, and Stephen W. Director assumed the deanship in 1996.</p>
      <p>In 1905 the Regents of the University approved the establishment of a chair of architecture in the Department of Engineering. With this decision, courses in architecture were once again made available. (In 1876-1877 William Le Baron Jenney had lectured as Professor of Architecture and Design in the new Department of Architecture and Design, which had been established in 1873 within the School of Mines. Due to a lack of funds, these courses were suspended in 1877. Jenney left the university in 1880, having fulfilled his obligations as architect for the university's new museum).</p>
      <p>By 1913 the Department of Engineering had become the Departments of Engineering and Architecture. The title was changed in 1915 to the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture. In 1931 the College of Architecture became an independent unit.</p>
      <p>In 1920, under the leadership of Dean Cooley, the Department of Engineering Research was formed as a means of promoting cooperation between the university, the state, and private industry. Through this department private industries sponsored research projects that would be conducted by College of Engineering faculty members. In addition to providing financial assistance, such projects enabled students and faculty members to engage in research of current interest in a wide variety of areas. Beginning in 1940, projects sponsored by the federal government were undertaken by the department and in 1948 the department was reorganized as the Engineering Research Institute. In 1957-1958 the Research Institute became an administrative unit of the university.</p>
      <p>Before World War II the College of Engineering focused primarily on undergraduate education and on providing students with practical experience and skill. The many technological advances that occurred during and after the war prompted an increased emphasis on research and theory and a corresponding emphasis on graduate education. This shift was reflected in the development of research facilities on the North Campus beginning in the 1950s with the Cooley Laboratory. Technological advances also prompted changes in the curriculum and structure of the college. Some new departments were created, such as Nuclear Engineering. Other departments shifted their emphases; Aeronautical Engineering, for example, became Aerospace Engineering. The records reflect these developments as well as the broad changes which took place in the College of Engineering from its inception in the late nineteenth century up to the 1970s.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s the College of Engineering continued to meet the technological challenges of the future through instruction, research, and development. Most of the college was relocated to North Campus in the early 1980s. This was followed by additional construction and renovation to house the college's major research initiatives, including the Center for Advanced Scientific Computation, created to study the applications of supercomputing, and the Center for Robotics and Integrated Manufacturing (CRIM), established in 1981 to examine the future needs of the modern manufacturing industry.</p>
      <p>Funding was a major concern of the college in the 1980s. The tightened budgets of the previous decade resulted in increased faculty teaching loads and decreased research resources. The college sought to rectify this situation by appealing to the state for increased funding, attempting to keep the University of Michigan's College of Engineering on par with its peer institutions. As it looked toward the 1990s, the goals of the college, as stated in College of Engineering Briefing Material 1988-89 (Box 52, Folder: Briefing Materials), were twofold: first, "to establish preeminence in certain areas of special relevance to the state and region," such as manufacturing science and technology, machine intelligence, systems integration, and engineering design; and second, "to establish preeminence in certain areas of research and education of anticipated importance to the future of technology," including advanced optics and electronics, materials science and technology, information technology, and biotechnology.</p>
      <p>By 1996, new programs had been added, most notably a Department of Biomedical Engineering and an Engineering Research Center for Reconfigurable Machining; the latter was chosen by the National Science Foundation to be the largest center in the country for basic research in manufacturing. The college also continued to increase its presence on North Campus, adding a carillon tower, the Robert H. Lurie Engineering Center, and a new library called the Media Union. The latter, shared with the schools of Architecture and Urban Planning, Music, and Art, was an ambitious project, described as a place where "new information technology will create a 'virtual' community of thinkers, allowing face-to-face dialogue and collaboration across thousands of miles".</p>

      <p>The College of Engineering records date from 1873 to 1996 and measure 94 linear feet. The records document the internal activities of the College of Engineering, both administrative and academic, the role of the college as a unit of the University of Michigan, and research developments and trends over the years. Correspondence, meeting minutes, reports, financial records, and other material reflect changing research interests within the field of engineering as well as the curriculum development that has accompanied technological advances. Of particular interest are the files relating to outside work by faculty members, a question of enduring concern within the college. The records reflect the relations of the College of Engineering with private industry, especially through the documentation of funding from outside sources and the involvement of professors in outside research.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Files series (41 linear feet) comprises the bulk of the record group, spanning the years 1904 to 1991, and includes the records of Deans Cooley, Sadler, Anderson, Crawford, Brown, Attwood, Van Wylen, Ragone, Duderstadt, Vest and Atkins.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The subseries Mortimer E. Cooley Correspondence Files and Herbert C. Sadler Correspondence Files are arranged chronologically, and, although consisting primarily of correspondence, they do include occasional reports and financial statements. Cooley's extensive correspondence (ca. 10 feet) with members of the college, prospective students, engineering graduates seeking employment, and engineering firms reflects the intimate involvement of Cooley in the administration of the College of Engineering, but also his continued interest in the more technical aspects of engineering, as is evident in his correspondence with manufacturers and engineers regarding equipment for the various departments. The files occasionally reflect the impact of larger events on affairs within the College of Engineering. For example, a series of letters written by professors and by engineering firms in 1918 concerns the question of whether or not to institute an intensive summer course to train women as draftsmen in order to fill shortages created by the war.</p>

            <p>The records of Henry C. Anderson are divided into two subseries: Henry C. Anderson Correspondence Files, arranged chronologically, and Henry C. Anderson Topical Files, arranged alphabetically by subject. The topical files not only document Anderson's activities as dean, but also his work throughout the 1930s in various capacities: as chairman of the State Board of Registration for Architects, Engineers, and Surveyors (1937-1939), and as a participant in such university organizations as a member of the Board in Control of Athletics, the Board in Control of Religious Activities, and the board of the Alumni Association. Minutes of these bodies are included, as well as a complete run of minutes of the Board of Governors of the Michigan League for the period from December 1931 to 1939.</p>

            <p>The subseries Ivan C. Crawford Correspondence Files is very small (2 folders), and supplements the larger subseries Ivan C. Crawford and Successors Topical Files (13 linear feet). This subseries contains topical files from the deanships of Crawford through Ragone and is arranged alphabetically. It provides documentation of the wide-ranging activities of the various departments within the College of Engineering. (It should be noted that there is a gap in the topical files; no folders were received for the letters I through L.) These files pertain more clearly to the work of the dean in administering the College of Engineering than do Anderson's topical files. Of particular interest are the early annual reports and advisory board minutes of the Department of Engineering Research and records of its successor, the Engineering Research Institute, from the 1930's to the 1950's. Although some of these folders predate Crawford's years as dean, they have been included here because they provide background information for the later records. Other notable files include the annual reports of the Cooley Memorial Laboratory; accreditation reports; and the files regarding Consulting, which consists of questionnaires in which engineering professors indicated the number of days spent doing consulting work in that academic year and the companies for which they worked. The Department Reviews files include committee reports on conditions within the departments and letters from faculty members evaluating their departments.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Communications with Regents files consists for the most part of requests for sabbaticals and sick leave and resolutions regarding faculty appointments.</p>

            <p>The subseries Charles Vest, 1986-1990 (5.8 linear feet) is. Although the majority of the materials date from the deanships of Charles M. Vest (1986-1989) and Daniel E. Atkins (Interim Dean, 1989-1990), the records do include some earlier materials. However, the researcher should be aware that there is a gap in the DEAN'S FILES series for the years 1980-1986; no records were received in this accession for the deanships of Hansford W. Farris (Acting Dean, 1980-1981) and James J. Duderstadt (1981-1986), which are more thoroughly documented in the 1993-1996 Accessions. Also, although in previous accessions the records regarding administrative duties, faculty and staff, and students are contained in their own series, in the 1992 Accession these types of records are included within the two series Dean's Files, 1986-1990 and Senior Associate Dean's Files, 1980-1992.</p>
            <p>The Dean's Files, 1986-1990 series is arranged alphabetically by topic and documents the wide-ranging issues and concerns facing the college during these years. The series is notable for its wealth of information on the College of Engineering's research and development efforts in an age of increasing technology. These efforts are documented in the folders "Centers, Institutes, and Laboratories"; "Committees"; "Development"; and "Research." Much of the information in this series is of an administrative nature, such as that found in the "Administration Files" (which include "Faculty" and "Staff" files), "Awards," and "Students." The large group of folders on Departments are also concerned mostly with administrative issues, but some contain departmental reviews. (The researcher interested in trends and developments within the various departments of the college will find more information in the Departmental Files section of the Senior Associate Dean's Files, 1980-1992.) Earlier materials include information on the college's relocation in 1982 to North Campus ("North Campus") and statistics ("Administration Files; Statistics and Peer Institute Data").</p>

            <p>The Dean's Office Files series is a continuation from previous accessions. It spans the years 1945-1991, although it primarily documents the period 1950 to 1990. The material includes correspondence, memoranda, reports and budgets, and tends to be administrative rather than personal records. The Dean's Office Files have been divided into two sub-subseries: Deans' Administrative Files and Deans' Departmental Files.</p>

              <p>The Deans' Administrative Files (3.5 linear feet) overlap chronologically with sections of earlier accessions, but provide more detailed documentation of program development, cooperative programs with private industry, experiments with instructional television, and the long-term planning which was required for the move to North Campus. This subseries is strongest for the years from the mid-1950s to mid-1980s.</p>

            <p>The James J. Duderstadt subseries (2.7 linear feet) provides some sense of his administrative duties and concerns as dean (1981-1986). Some of the major issues which are documented here are the response of the college to advances in computer and other technologies; efforts to encourage a more diverse student body; construction plans on North Campus; and coping with funding problems.</p>

          <p>The Associate Dean's Files (10 linear feet) are divided into five subseries: Chronological Files of Charles Vest; Senior Associate Dean's Files, 1980-1992; and Project Files of Daniel E. Atkins, 1981-1989, H.F. Fogler Files and M. J. Sinnott Files.</p>
          <p>The series Chronological Files of Charles Vest is arranged chronologically and covers the years 1981 to 1988. These files contain both personal and administrative records and reflect Vest's personal areas of research interest and knowledge. Correspondence with colleagues and reviews for journals of the work of other professionals comprise the bulk of the material. The closed folder contains his evaluations of doctoral dissertations. Additional files of Charles vest were received in the 1992 accession, boxes 61-62.</p>

            <p>After Peter M. Banks became the dean of the College of Engineering in 1990, the position of Senior Associate Dean was created. Erdogan Gulari, formerly the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, was appointed to this position. In addition, the positions of Associate Dean of Graduate Education and Associate Dean of Research and Undergraduate Education were also created, thereby relieving the senior associate dean of student concerns and allowing Gulari to focus on departmental issues and faculty development. (This reorganization is not documented within the records.) The subseries Senior Associate Dean's Files, 1980-1992 includes Gulari's files from his years as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs as well as his files from his first years as Senior Associate Dean.</p>
            <p>The Senior Associate Dean's Files, 1980-1992 subseries is sub-divided into Departmental Files and Administrative Files. The Departmental Files are a valuable source of information regarding the research emphases of the various departments during the 1980s and includes such forms of documentation as departmental reviews and faculty appointments. For earlier information regarding departmental activities, the researcher should refer to the department files scattered throughout the DEAN'S FILES series (see especially Ivan C. Crawford and Successors' Topical Files subseries). Budget materials for the individual departments are located in the Administrative Files. Issues relating to students are also represented in the Administrative Files in such folders as "Affirmative Action and Racism Issues", "Enrollment", "Graduate Students", and "Minority Engineering Program Office".</p>

            <p>The Project Files of Daniel E. Atkins, 1981-1989 subseries reflects some of the major projects of the College of Engineering in which Atkins was involved, and include material created during his tenure as Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs. The files are divided into six sections. The section "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" documents the merger of academic computing units at the university into one department within the College of Engineering and includes reviews from various years. The section "Experimental Research in Electronic Submission Project", or EXPRES, traces the evolution of the project from its initial funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1986 to 1989 when NSF discontinued funding. This section is divided into Chronological Files and Topical Files. Both files contain similar types of material, such as research proposals and activity reports; however, the Chronological Files include the meeting minutes of the Advisory Committee.</p>
            <p>The two sections "Industrial Technology Institute" (ITI) and "Center for Robotics and Integrated Manufacturing" (CRIM) document the establishment of these important research facilities in the early 1980s and include proposals, correspondence, reports, and newsclippings. Information regarding the relationship between the two facilities is located in the CRIM section in the folders "Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) and CRIM." The section "Institute of Science and Technology" is not as well documented as the other two research facilities and consists of correspondence and reviews. There are two folders from Atkins' participation as a member of the 1988 "Provost Search Advisory Committee"; these are closed to researchers.</p>

            <p>The M.J. Sinnott subseries (1 linear foot) runs from 1967 to 1984; it contains some files created by Sinnott's predecessor as Associate Dean, W.H. Farris. The subseries documents administrative concerns such as staffing, grant applications, accreditation and space allocation. The "Macnee Willow Run Report" folders [box 60] document deliberations surrounding the appropriate use of Willow Run Laboratories, which was a controversial issue during the late 1960s.</p>

          <p>The Committee Records series (7.8 linear feet) dates from 1887 to 1984 and contains nearly complete runs of the minutes of the Executive Committee from its inception in 1936 to 1984 and of the Standing Committee for the period 1887 to 1983. The Standing Committee, composed of the dean, assistant dean, and chairmen of the various departments, was created in 1906 to replace an earlier advisory committee that consisted of five faculty members and the dean as an ex-officio member. The Standing Committee was responsible for approving appointments, buildings and rooms, repairs to buildings, and apparatus and equipment. The Standing Committee series includes minutes of meetings and correspondence that give a broad view of issues that were of interest to the students and faculty in engineering. The early minutes, for example, express the concern that engineering education was too technical and did not provide a broad liberal education.</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee was formed in 1936 as part of the Standing Committee. Its duties were to investigate and formulate educational and research policy and to consider matters of budget, promotions and appointments, and plant extension. The minutes of the Executive Committee relate to student petitions about requirements, faculty appointments, sabbaticals and sick leaves, travel expenses, building expansion, and curriculum development. Although fairly routine in the later years, the resolutions regarding research contracts with private companies included in the early minutes provide an overview of the research projects faculty members engaged in and of the relations between industry and the College of Engineering. A subject and name index for the period 1936 to 1946 provides easy access to the Executive Committee minutes. Also included in this series is a 1926 report on entering students by the Committee on the Study of Engineering Education and a 1930 file of the Committee on Engineering</p>
          <p>Also included are minutes of the Administrative, Curriculum and Standing Committees. The Committee on Discipline minutes (1913-1923) provide an unusual record of some engineering students' infractions, academic and otherwise, and of punishments meted out by the committee. Several of the Dean's Topical Files include files on various committees.</p>

          <p>The Faculty Records series (5.5 linear feet) covers the years 1873 to 1986 and consists primarily of minutes of faculty meetings and faculty biographies; other materials include photographic rosters of the engineering faculty and a small amount of correspondence, reports, and miscellaneous material. Included in the reports is an undated report written by Professor DeVolson Wood, who taught at the University from 1857 to 1872, regarding needs of the Department of Engineering for an additional professor and appropriation requests and research reports written by faculty members in the 1870's and 1880's.</p>
          <p>Minutes of faculty meetings span the period 1895 to 1968 and deal for the most part with curriculum development and student requirements. Biographies of faculty members consist of questionnaires filled out by professors in the 1950's and 1960's in which they describe their educational background, teaching and industrial experience, consulting work and other activities outside of academic appointments, professional society membership, and related subjects. These biographical sketches provide substantial information on the subject of outside research by faculty members.</p>

          <p>The Student and Alumni Records series (6.75 linear feet) consists of a roster of admissions to the Engineering program from 1895 to 1922; a statement of requirements for admission in 1912; newsletters, directories, and miscellaneous items of alumni; lists of Mechanical Engineering graduates in the 1930's; and minutes of the annual meeting of the Class Officers Council of the Alumni Association for March 1943. The Alumni subseries contains an eighteen volume set of responses to questionnaires which were sent to College alumni in 1973. The alumni gave their opinions about the pertinence of College curricula and programs to their careers, and also responded to questions about counseling and specific departments. Alumni also contains a nearly complete set of reunion records for the class of 1904E, with correspondence and Annual Reports that provide a unique picture of class members' lives over the course of more than 60 years. Photographs of 1904E reunions are stored in box 82.</p>
          <p>The Students subseries includes records of student life dating from 1902 to 1991. Some items of interest in the subseries are course evaluations from the 1980s; a file on the development of the College Honor System; and a "Camp Davis Diary", kept by a student during the annual summer surveying camp in 1915.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Staff Records series (1966-1982) consists of one linear foot of Development Office records regarding two fund-raising campaigns: the 55 Million Campaign and the Capital Campaign. The 55 Million Campaign was a university-wide effort; files here reflect the College of Engineering's contacts with various corporations. The Capital Campaign, which ran from 1972-1979, was limited to the College of Engineering, and served as a model for the university-wide Capital Campaign which began in 1980. Materials here include internal reports, pamphlets, donor lists, memos, and some correspondence.</p>

          <p>College Administration is a catch-all series of files created by administrative staff at the College of Engineering. Most of these records date from the years 1968 to 1989, although some were created as early as 1902. The series should be considered in tandem with previous accessions, as there is some overlap in terms of both chronology and content. The series is divided into five subseries: Older Administrative Files [pre-1960]; Departmental Files; Financial Records; Topical Files; and Awards.</p>

            <p>The Older Administrative Files [pre-1960] (1.75 linear feet) contain correspondence, memoranda, reports and meeting minutes dating from 1902 to 1962. Of particular interest are detailed enrollment statistics from the 1940s and 1950s, records concerning curriculum development, and files on cooperative programs between the College and the military during both world wars.</p>

            <p>The Departmental Files subseries (3.5 linear feet) dates from 1965 to 1985 and contains memoranda, reports and some correspondence. The records were received, and are filed, in two sections: a "General" alphabetical file and "Departmental Reviews". The latter were carried out internally and often contain frank assessments of the strengths, weaknesses and future plans of the department under review. For several departments, reviews have been conducted in conjunction with chairman searches. For a more detailed description of the departmental review process, see the file "Departmental Reviews - Policy and Schedule" [box 66].</p>

            <p>Topical Files (3.5 linear feet) is a very diverse subseries which consists of correspondence, memoranda, and reports. The subseries covers the years 1930 to 1985, although most files date from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. The Topical Files contain Annual Reports; a 1980 External Review; faculty records, including Faculty Meeting Minutes from 1968 to 1983; and Sabbatical Leave Reports from the early 1980s.</p>

          <p>The series of Visual Materials (1.5 linear feet) consists of photographs which portray the activities, facilities, faculty, and alumni of the College of Engineering and consist generally of black and white positive prints. This series contains the photographs received in each of the accessions of records from the College of Engineering.</p>
          <p>The photographs date from the late nineteenth century to 1996, and include portraits of faculty and students; interiors and exteriors of buildings; laboratory scenes from the 1910s and 1920s; and aerial views of North Campus. The "Miscellaneous Buildings and Faculty" binder contains some of the earliest photographs of Engineering buildings and laboratories, and some unusual pictures of faculty, such as a group inspecting the new 1932 Hudson Essex automobile. The oversize photographs in box 83 consist of class composite portraits from the nineteenth century; portraits of prominent alumni dating from the 1910s and 1920s; and a group picture taken at Camp Davis in 1885. For portraits of former faculty, the researcher should also examine the Photographic Rosters from the years 1960-1979 located in the Faculty Records series (Box 35).</p>
          <p>The oversize photographs in box 83, 94 and two outsize folders consist of class composite portraits from the 1860s to the 1930s (with some missing years); portraits of prominent alumni dating from the 1910s and 1920s; and a group picture taken at Camp Davis in 1885.</p>
          <p>The videotape in the Visual Materials series was made in 1974, and is the result of a National Closed-Circuit Telecast fundraising program.</p>
