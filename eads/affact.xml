      <p>The University of Michigan Affirmative Action Program was developed in 1972 in response to federal laws passed in the 1960s to guarantee equal opportunity in employment for women and minorities. To comply with the federal regulations, the university developed recruiting practices and set goals and timetables for achieving equality for women and minorities in employment. Since 1970, the university has issued an Annual Compliance Report to the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). Much of the program's work during the early 1970s revolved around preparation of these reports and interpreting HEW criteria.</p>
      <p>Nellie M. Varner was appointed first director of the Affirmative Action Program. Varner's main responsibility was to interpret the specific guidelines that were issued in October, 1972 by the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (OCR-HEW guidelines). Her task was to create a university framework to meet these guidelines. As explained in the University Record of October 16, 1972, "These new guidelines spell out methods which colleges and universities must use in complying with Federal nondiscrimination orders. They include the setting of either percentage or numerical goals for hiring women and minorities...'The major job of my office,' says Dr. Varner, 'is in working out these procedures for monitoring to see if achievement of policy is made. After identifying deficiencies constructive recommendations can be made to the executive officers.'"</p>
      <p>The director also served as a liaison between the university, federal government officials, and the university's Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women. The commissions were established by President Robben Fleming in 1971. His charge to the commissions was to examine university policies, procedures, and practices which might contribute to discrimination against minority groups and women, and to review the Affirmative Action Program of the university and make recommendations. The commissions and the program worked together to develop procedures for affirmative action and also submitted recommendations to the president for improving programs within the university.</p>
      <p>In 1976 the Affirmative Action Program was reorganized. The name was changed to Affirmative Action Office and the Commissions for Minority Affairs and Women were integrated with the office. The move was designed to eliminate duplication of efforts and more efficiently focus activity on the eradication of discriminatory practices. The timing for the move was also right. Gwendolyn Baker had just been appointed the new director of the Affirmative Action Office and the two commission's chairmanships were about to expire. Charles Allemand replaced Gwendolyn Baker as director of the Affirmative Action Office in 1978.</p>
      <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the office expanded beyond the protection of women and minorities. The groups protected by nondiscrimination laws and policies grew to include individuals with handicaps, people between the ages of 40 and 70, and veterans of the Vietnam War. In addition, the list of characteristics against which institutions could not discriminate included religion, national origin, height, weight, marital status, and sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>In 1980 Virginia Nordby became director of the Affirmative Action office. The office was divided into compliance and programs teams, with Nordby overseeing both. This division reflects the two major functions of the office, that of meeting federal affirmative action guidelines, and serving the needs of groups or individuals on campus protected by nondiscrimination laws.</p>
      <p>According to a September, 1987 Affirmative Action Office newsletter, the compliance team is responsible for all the data retrieval, analysis, and reporting necessary for writing the reports on minority student recruitment and retention, faculty and staff employment, and affirmative action compliance required by the university and the federal government. Much of this function involves monitoring the race and gender composition of the faculty, staff, and student body; setting affirmative action goals and monitoring progress made toward achieving them; and monitoring faculty and staff recruitment (In the <title render="italic">Affirmative</title>, vol. 5, 1987-1988)</p>
      <p>The program team addresses the needs of members of protected groups through grievance counseling, program development, and policy recommendations. It also provides workshops to the university community. The workshops offered include Combating Sexual Harassment; Valuing Diversity: Anti-Racism Education and Training; Stares and Stair: Achieving Attitudinal and Architectural Accessibility; Managing AIDS in the Workplace; Understanding Affirmative Action and Nondiscrimination; Recruiting and Retaining a Diversified Staff; and Managing an Aging Workforce. In 1991, the office held the first campus-wide diversity and resource forum. At the forum, people learned about the many creative programs and strategies used by different university units to make a better environment in which people of all races, creeds, and cultures, live, work, and study.</p>
      <p>The Affirmative Action Office also works with constituency groups, which are composed of volunteers united by a common cause who are willing to work together on projects to improve the university. The office provides direct staff and financial support to such groups as the Academic Women's Caucus, the African-American Organizations Coalition, the Age Concerns Council, the Association of Black Professionals and Administrators, the Commission for Women, the Women of Color Task Force, the Men of Color Task Force, the Task Force on Sexual Orientation, and the Women's Initiative Group.</p>
      <p>In 1988 Virginia Nordby left the Affirmative Action Office. Mary Ann Swain became the interim director. In 1989, Zaida I. Giraldo became the director. In 1992, Jimmy A. Myers took over the position as Interim Director. On February 15, 1994 the Affirmative Action Office combined with the Personnel Office to become the Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action. Jackie McClain was appointed as the executive director.</p>

      <p>The records of the Affirmative Action Office date from 1969-1993 and document the activities of the office and its predecessors and provide information about affirmative action programs at the university and the status of minority, women, the disabled and other groups on campus. The records have come to the library in a number of accessions.</p>
      <p>The Affirmative Action Office record group is organized into five subgroups: Affirmative Action Office, 1969-1993; Commission for Minority Affairs, 1971-1980; Commission for Women, 1970-1985; Council for Minority Concerns, 1979-1983; and Advisory Committee on Affirmative Action Programs, 1977-1986. The Affirmative Action Office subgroup includes records created or acquired by the Office. The other subgroups represent various university units that were merged into or whose function were taken over by the Affirmative Action Office.</p>

          <p>The Affirmative Action Office subgroup is divided into five principle series: General Files, 1969-1993; Affirmative Action Coordinators; Audio-Visual Materials; Reports; and Title IX. Materials belonging to each of these series, and the General Files in particular, may have been received in more than one of the accessions and there may be overlaps in the date spans among the accessions.</p>

            <p>The General Files are largely topical files created by the Affirmative Action Office. They are organized into subseries representing the files received in each of the major accessions. Each of the subseries covers a span of years and is arranged alphabetically. There is considerable overlap in the time spans of the various subseries.</p>

            <scopecontent>
              <p>The General Files for 1970-1978 include Availability Assessments, Compliance Program Reports, Goals and Timetables, and correspondence with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). Availability Assessments were projections of retirements, resignations, and new positions, and the pool of women and minorities available to fill these positions. These projections were used to set goals and the timetables for achieving them. Compliance Program Reports were compiled by the Affirmative Action Office from data gathered from all of the schools and departments.</p>
              <p>Other significant files relate to the Hayes Study. Robert H. Hayes and Associates, an outside consulting firm, was hired to provide the university with improved systems for merit review, merit promotion and transfer, and to develop a comprehensive personnel compensation policy to cover professional and administrative employees. The Management Advisory Group made recommendations to the executive officers on professional and administrative plan implementation.</p>

              <p>Data and background material for the Department of Labor Compliance Reviews and files on handicap programs and issues together account for the bulk of the 1971-1987 General Files subseries. There is more documentation of handicap issues than in the previous accessions, and there is especially good coverage of the university's observance of the United Nations' International Year of Disabled Persons (1981). A summary of the events and activities sponsored by the university during that year can be found in the "Final Report" (box 22). Files on "Minorities" and on "Women" contain substantial information regarding "Minority Women's Career Conferences" (boxes 22-23), "Women's Career Fairs" (box 24), and the "Women's Network" (box 24). The Career Conference and Career Fair files reflect the university's continuing interest in aiding the professional development of women by providing practical information on career options through workshops, help in developing basic skills, and inspiration through well-known key-note speakers. It is clear from these files that the university's commitment focuses not only on women of minority status, but also in general on female staff and students of the university, as well as women in and around the community of Ann Arbor. The Women's Network functions as a liaison group between various women's organizations on campus, and includes representatives from the Affirmative Action Office, the Commission for Women, the Center for the Continuing Education of Women, and the Academic Women's Caucus. Network files include budget reviews, correspondence, and minutes; subjects include child care, sexual harassment, and tenure of women faculty. Unique to this subseries are general files which document the university's policies on "Sexual Harassment" and "Sexual Preference".</p>

            <p>The Audio-Visual Materials series includes audio-cassettes, photographs, videocassettes and videotapes. Most come from the university's observance of International Women's Year in 1976. Included are discussions about the development and evolution of affirmative action programs and a speech and press conference given by Betty Friedan. There is also a small group of 30 black and white prints and 7 proof sheets depicting handicap accessibility devices and handicapped persons participating in rowing programs.</p>

            <p>The Reports series (10 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically by topic. The largest set of reports is compliance reports (1980-1988), prepared pursuant to federal regulations. The reports are arranged by University of Michigan campus (Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Flint), with a separate run for the University Hospital. Missing volumes are noted on the contents list. The compliance reports provide extensive data on the composition of the university work force. Summaries of the compliance reports are also available in the Publications subgroup (Report to the Regents).</p>
            <p>In preparing the compliance reports the Affirmative Action Office relies in part on utilization analyses and workforce analyses. Utilization analyses result in computer generated reports of the university workforce that compare the current workforce with a "model staff" of women and/or minorities. Reports are available for the years 1977-1979 and provide useful, detailed analysis of women and/or minorities in the university workforce. Workforce analyses are available from 1977 to 1980 and are listings of regular university job titles by job groups. The total number of employees in each job is reported, as well as the total number of females and the total number of minorities. For a more complete explanation of terms used in Affirmative Action reports, the researcher should examine the Reports to the Regents, located in the Publications subgroup.</p>
            <p>The Monthly Status Reports, covering the years 1979-1987, detail the preparation of the federal compliance reports and also the various support and community involvement activities of the Affirmation Action Office. Each staff member submits a monthly report on his or her activities. The Monthly Status Reports are useful for gaining an overview of the daily work of the Affirmative Action Office.</p>

          <p>Records of the Commission contain papers relating to the history, operating procedures, and organization and structure of the commission as well as topical information, correspondence, committees, cluster, and school and department files. Much of the work of the commission was done through committees. Clusters were based on units within the university and were set up to review affirmative action goals. Cluster and committee files contain minutes, memoranda, reports, and recommendations. Correspondence files are arranged chronologically and include the correspondence of chairwomen Barbara Newell, Virginia Davis Nordin, and Eunice Burns, and co-chairwoman Sarah Goddard Power. Papers in the topical files contain correspondence and memoranda, recommendations, and background material. There is an overlap of information and papers among the topical, committee, and general correspondence files. Schools and Departments files consist mainly of correspondence relating to charges of discrimination or unfair treatment.</p>
          <p>Commissions for Women were established within the Medical Center, Schools of Education and Public Health, and on the Dearborn campus. Each of these commissions had a liaison reporting to the president's commission. Included in the files of the Commission for Women are papers relating to these commissions and the Commission for Minority Groups.</p>
          <p>The subgroup contains a single audio cassette of an International Women's Year banquet held on April 9, 1976. Addie Wyatt, a leader in the battle against sexual and racial discrimination, was the speaker. She was introduced by Sarah Goddard Power, and a resolution honoring her was read by Representative Perry Bullard.</p>
          <p>The CFW records include a complete run of the "Women's Information Network Bulletin" for the years 1972 to 1985. The "Women's Information Network Bulletins", published by the commission, document its continuing emphasis on campus child care, disability benefits, and sexual harassment.</p>
