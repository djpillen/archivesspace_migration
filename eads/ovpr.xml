      <p>After World War II the burden of overseeing the university's rapidly expanding research programs fell upon the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. The dean's broad responsibility for research activity was formally acknowledged in 1959 when Dean Ralph A. Sawyer was given the additional title of Vice President for Research (VPR). The Office of the Vice President for research (OVPR) supports and administers large interdisciplinary projects called research centers and also administers research institutes. Research projects which have been overseen by the VPR include the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project, which provides beneficial uses for atomic energy; the Institute of Science and Technology (IST), which managed large research projects that did not fit into the existing academic structure; and the Institute for Social Research (ISR), which undertakes substantial programs in survey research, political behavior, and other areas.</p>
      <p>For practical reasons, the University of Michigan Research Institute (UMRI) was assigned to aid Sawyer in carrying out the administrative tasks of the VPR. The administrative relationship between the VPR and UMRI was formalized in 1961 with UMRI becoming the Office of Research Administration. The function of the Office of Research Administration is to assist faculty members in obtaining support for their research projects and to maintain appropriate records of university research projects. In 1972 the ORA became the Division of Research Development and Administration (DRDA).</p>
      <p>At the time of Dean Sawyer's retirement, in 1964, a decision was made to separate the vice presidency from the deanship. Arthur Geoffrey Norman, a professor of botany at Michigan since 1952 and director of the university's botanical gardens since 1955, was named to replace Sawyer as vice president. Some of the problems facing the new VPR were recovering indirect costs of large research programs, integrating research with instructional programs, and developing interdisciplinary research.</p>
      <p>During the early 1960s much of the work of the OVPR was involved in overseeing the expansion of government funded research. The majority of sponsored research funds went to engineering and scientific research projects, but as the decade advanced more research funds were received by the social and health sciences. Prior to 1966/67 sponsored research funds had increased an average of 13% to 14% a year, but from 1966 to 1968 a rise of only 5% was reported. By 1968/69 sponsored research had reached a plateau. This was caused in part by a leveling of federal funds and because available faculty time and research space had reached a saturation point.</p>
      <p>Classified research policy was a topic of great debate during the late 1960s and early 1970s. A new policy was put into effect in 1968 and then revised in 1972. The 1972 revision prohibits research activities, the foreseeable result of which is to destroy or incapacitate human life, and restrictions that limit open publication of results beyond one year. Interpretation of the new policy resulted in the Willow Run Laboratories disassociating itself from the university, since the majority of university classified research occurred there.</p>
      <p>In 1972, although he continued to perform various tasks within OVPR, Norman retired from the vice presidency. He was succeeded by Charles G. Overberger, who had joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1967 and was then chairman of the Chemistry Department. During Overberger's tenure in OVPR, research expenditures increased only 2.4% when adjusted for inflation during the 1970s. In the 1979/80 academic year the distribution of sponsored research funds was 43.3% life sciences, 20% engineering, 16.7% social sciences, 8.9% physical sciences, 1.3% humanities, and 9.8% other.</p>
      <p>Overberger resigned in 1983. Rather than seek an immediate replacement, a major study was authorized to determine if the 1964 decision to separate the vice presidency from the deanship of the graduate school should be reversed. While the study was underway, Alfred A. Sussman was named interim VPR while also continuing in his position as Dean of the Graduate School. Eventually it was concluded that the two posts would remain separate, and in 1985 Linda S. Wilson was named vice president for research. Wilson resigned in 1989 and William C. Kelley became interim vice president. In 1990 he became the permanent vice president for research.</p>

      <p>The records of the vice-president for research date from 1950 to 2001 and measure 179 linear feet. The records document the activities of the office overseeing grant funded research at the University of Michigan and offer some insight into the range of research undertaken at the university. Records include administrative files of vice-presidents, including correspondence, memoranda, and budgetary material relating to research projects and grants of university units and departments; and photographs.</p>
      <p>The organization of the records, particularly the early accessions, reflects the tenure of the successive vice presidents for research. Later accessions included files of associate vice-presidents and senior staff officers as well topically organized files that spanned the tenure of several vice presidents. The records are organized into the following series:</p>

            <p>The General File subseries is composed of two sub-units, the Reference Files and the Research Support/Interest File. Reference (1958-1972) dates primarily from 1964 to 1972. It is arranged alphabetically using a combination of institutional titles and subject headings. Its overall quality is uneven, being detailed in some areas but cursory in others. Well documented areas include the Computing Center, the Dental Research Institute, the Highway Safety Research Institute and Indirect Costs. the Research Support/Interest File (1961-1972) documents agencies, corporations, or individuals which funded or had the potential to fund research activities. Included here for convenience are agencies of the federal government, although the vice-president's office originally maintained these as a separate file.</p>
            <p>Additional General File material was received in 1986 consisting primarily of Classified Research Committee files and Research Policy Committee minutes. These records are housed in boxes 70 and 71.</p>

          <p>The Charles G. Overberger series (1950-1984) dates primarily from 1972 to 1981. When Overberger first took office, the file arrangement bore some similarity to that of his predecessor, however about 1978 the structure of the files was radically altered.</p>
          <p>Prior to 1978 the Overberger series consisted of three subseries, General File, Report Files, and the Consortium File. The General File is made up of three subdivisions, Reference (1958-1972), Research Support/Interests (1961-1972), and Budget (1973/74 to 1976/77). The first two subdivisions continue the files of the same name established by Norman. The Reference File is particularly informative in the matter of Awards, Equipment (usually major pieces of research equipment), Indirect Costs, Patents, and Willow Run Laboratories. The Research Support/Interest Files again contains a large amount of information about funding received through various federal agencies. The Budget file is an addition grafted onto the General Files by Overberger.</p>
          <p>Also unique to the Overberger series is the Report File. Arranged alphabetically and primarily dating from 1972 to 1978 (span dates 1950-1982), the series contains information about the various university units that report to the vice-president for research, as well as a small amount of information about research in General at the university. Information about many of the units listed in the Reports File are also found in the General File. Major activities and units found in the Reports File include the Dental Research Institute, the Division of Research Development and Administration, the Institute of Environmental Quality, the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, and Radiation Policy Committee, and various projects involving computers and computerization and Great Lakes research.</p>
          <p>The Overberger series contains a Consortiums Files (1972-1977) similar in purpose and arrangement to the same file in the Norman series. Within the Overberger Series Consortiums File there is some material created by Norman. Norman continued to serve as the university representative to two consortiums well after his retirement as vice-president. In addition to continuing files on the Argonne University Associates, the Institute for Defense Analysis and the University Research Association, the file contains a quantity of information on the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.</p>
          <p>Around 1978 the Overberger filing system was radically altered. The vice-president's office abandoned the multiple file system in favor of a single alphabetically arranged Topical File, generally divided on an annual basis. The Topical files generally focused on a single year, but included material form earlier years, and later material was sometimes added to the file. Four such Topical files have been received from Overberger and his successors; 1973-83 (primarily 1978-79); 1975-83 (primarily 1979-80); 1976-84 (primarily 1980-81); 1966-1985 (primarily 1982-1984, Overberger/Sussman).</p>

          <p>The Central Files series is a topical arrangement of files maintained centrally by the staff in the OVPR. The Central Files are divided in two subseries based on the dates covered by the files: Pre-1997 (12.5 linear feet); and 1997-2000 6.5 linear feet). Both series are arranged alphabetically by topic. The files appear to have been added to and used by staff members at several levels. The records reflect in a general nature, the changing research environment both nationwide and at the University of Michigan. The wide range of areas in which the OVPR had a role and influence is also evident.</p>
          <p>Of particular note are files related to the issue of Indirect Costs, which came to the national forefront in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Central Files series includes approximately 1 linear foot of records relating to indirect costs from the period of 1988 to 1996. Also of note are files relating to emerging national topics like Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the preservation of intellectual property, as seen in records related to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), and a growing concern for undergraduate research and education, as evidenced in the several related National Science Foundation (NSF) files.</p>
          <p>The Central Files also provide a varying degree of detail on the various subunits within the OVPR. Of particular strength are files related to the Biophysics Research Division (BRD), the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS), the Institute for Social Research (ISR), and the Institute of Science and Technology (IST). Among the Michigan initiatives that are well documented is the Committee on a Multicultural University.</p>
          <p>The 1997-2000 Central Files continues the earlier Central Files run, and includes records dating back to 1993.</p>
          <p>The 2009 addition to the Centeral Files series continues the series from previous accessions. Dates on the records for this series span all the way back to the first Vice President for Research, but the majority of the records originate from the offices of four Vice Presidents for Research: Homer Neal, Frederick C. Niedhart, Fawwaz Ulaby, and Stephen R. Forrest. The series is divided into two sub-series: Topical Files, 1951-2005; and Awards, 1987-2006. The files in each sub-series are arranged alphabetically. Notable topics covered in the Topical Files sub-series include Human Subject Research, Stem Cell and Embryonic Research, and Bioterrorism. There is also an abundance of material on the Arts of Citizenship (AoC) program, the Institute of Gerontology (IoG0, and the Research Responsibility Program (RRP). Another interesting file entitled <title render="italic">Darkness in El Dorado</title>, focuses on a controversy surrounding a book of the same title written by Patrick Tierney. The book levels serious accusations against two UM-affiliated researchers, Dr.'s Neel and Chagnon, and work they completed with the Yanomami Tribes of Venezuela.</p>
          <p>The Central Files series accession of 2010 continues the series from previous accessions, and includes two sub-series: Topical Files,1985-2006; and Awards, 1997-2004. The majority of the records in the Topical Files sub-series originate from the offices of Fawwaz Ulaby and Stephen R. Forrest, though earlier files are included as well. Many of the files included in the sub-series contain documents on various technological initiatives happening in and around the university, and there are a number of files on Technology Transfer. The files in the Topical Files sub-series are arranged alphabetically.</p>

            <p>The Awards sub-series includes nomination and deliberation materials, as well as correspondence regarding awards, fellowship, and grants received by research faculty. The Research Scientist Awards are particularly well-documented, with a complete run of files from 1987-2004. However, the amount of materials in each file decreases in later years.</p>
            <p>The Awards sub-series from the 2010 accession includes files on Faculty Grants and Awards from 2002 and 2003, as well as a few scattered files dating from 1997 to 2001. These files included proposals, budgets, and correspondence on grants and awards received by research faculty. Also included are files on the Distinguished Research Scientist Award from 2000 to 2002, and 2004.</p>

            <p>Interim Vice President, Alfred Sussman continued to use the annual Topical File organizational system as a template. The Overberger and Sussman files are interfiled in a single alphabet for the 1987 accession, boxes 72-87. The office added new files to the alphabet as needed. Among the new files generated 1982-1984 were: The Megaproposals file to track University initiatives to generate funds to support large scale research; similar new files on a regional supercomputer and a superconducting supercollider; and files on groups reacting against the expansion of research include the Michigan Student Assembly and Nuclear Free Zone files. The Budget Priorities Committee's material provides insights into downsizing of the University during the early eighties. The Annual Reports to the President attempt to file departmental reports in one place. The material germane to the decision in 1974 to keep the VPR and the deanship of graduate studies separate can be found in the Vice President, Research Series in box 87.</p>

          <p>The Linda S. Wilson series (boxes 88-96) consists of Topical Files created during her tenure as vice president from 1985 to 1989 (some files, however, date from 1981). The topical File is divided into two chronological spans, 1984-1990 (1990 accession) and 1980-1990 (1993 accession). Wilson continued to use the same file system originated by Overberger: a single alphabetical arrangement. Among the new files generated under Wilson are: the Conflict of Interest Task Force, concerning policy revision; the Gifts, Grants, and Contracts Committee Report, on how to accelerate and facilitate the process of identifying and reporting gift transfers to the university; International Peace and Security Research, concerning a new research center; Michigan Technology Transfer Network, on promoting the transfer of technical and business expertise to the business sector; the Research Excellence and Development Fund, on using state resources for job creation and economic revitalization in Michigan; New and Emerging Technology Task Force; and Radioactive Waste Disposal.</p>
          <p>Some of the larger groupings of continuing files for 1985 to 1989 are the Division of Research Administration and Development (administrative files), the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine, Electron Microbeam Analysis Laboratory, Macromolecular Research Center, Michigan Sea Grant College Program, and the Super Conducting Supercollider. There are also staff meeting agendas and minutes from 1985 to 1989.</p>

          <p>The William C. Kelley (Interim Term) Series includes materials from Kelley's tenure as the Interim Vice President for Research. The bulk of the materials are from 1989-1990, although some materials date from the 1950s through the 1980s. [There is also a set of photocopied documents generated by the 1986 DRDA Review which date from 1911 (Box 105, folder "1986 DRDA Review - Documents, 1911-1986).] There are three sub-series within the overall series. The Central Files (1.7 feet) are arranged alphabetically and cover largely the year 1990. Topics include relations with the College of Engineering and the School of Nursing, and government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Committees Files (1.1 feet) contain materials related to Committees that report to the OVPR. Also arranged alphabetically, these files are primarily administrative in nature, consisting mainly of committee rosters and charges. A notable exception in this sub-series is the material of the Radiation Policy Committee (Box 104). The records of this committee are both more extensive and more informative than others in the sub-series. The final sub-series, the Review Files (1.7 feet), contains material pertaining to reviews of several divisions that report to OVPR (DRDA, ISR, Macromolecular Science and Engineering, and the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project). In addition, there is 0.5 linear feet of material from the Research Policies Committee which contains correspondence, reports, and meeting minutes.</p>

          <p>Compared to the chronological Central Files, the OVPR Staff Files (7 linear feet) contain more detailed records compiled by OVPR staff members according to their areas of responsibility. Because of the on-going nature of issues in each staff member's portfolio, the records span the tenures of several Vice Presidents for Research, with the series as a whole covering the Vice Presidencies of Alfred Sussman, Linda Wilson, William Kelly, Homer Neal, Frederick Neidhardt, and Fawwaz Ulaby. Moreover, the files represent the work of several OVPR staff members, most notably Administrative Manager Sandy Whitesell and OVPR Research Policy Advisor Judy Nowack. Many of Whitesell's records, which include the files on director searches, indirect costs, space allocation, the OVPR transition, and the ILIR and UMTRI reviews, reflect her role as staff support for OVPR functions carried out by the Linda Wilson, Nowack or Judith Pitney, who was the Director of Planning and Administrative Services. Nowack's own records include the files on the Middle English Dictionary, Research Council, and Unit Grievance Procedures. Also represented are files from Associate VPs Hemalata Dandekar (SRL Review/CSCAR Creation) and Sarah Newman (CHGD and Joint IOG/CHGD/RSP Reviews), and DRDA Director Alan Steiss (RSP Review). These position titles are as of 1989; circa 1996, only Steiss' title remained the same. Judy Nowack had become Assistant VP, Whitesell was Assistant to the VP, and the others had left the Office. Later files thus reflect these changes, with the addition of some records from Jacqueline Hoats (secretary for Judy Nowack), Senior Science Writer Lee Katterman, Associate VP Julie Ellison, Assistant VP Marvin Parnes, and Robert Samors, who worked in the University's Washington, D.C. Office. (Also see Parnes' series for more of his records.)</p>
          <p>This series is notable for its reflection of many changes in the landscape of OVPR responsibilities over the years. Subjects covered include the creation of CSCAR (the Center for Statistical Consulting and Research) and the disbanding of SRL (the Statistical Research Laboratory, more commonly referred to as the 'StatLab') over the period from 1988-1992, the completion of the Middle English Dictionary (in 2001, after over half a century of work on the project), and several transfers of units away from the OVPR to various U-M schools and colleges. These include the transfer of ILIR (the Institute for Labor and Industrial Relations) to the Schools of Business Administration and Social Work in 1991-1993, and the reorganizations of IST (the Institute for Science and Technology), which resulted in the transfer of most of its subunits away from the purview of the OVPR during 1986-1990. The series also includes records on the transition of the OVPR Vice Presidency from Linda Wilson to William Kelly in 1989, which included a proposed change of function of the Vice-President for Research from a Vice-President to a Vice-Provost, with the resulting transfer of the OVPR's reporting lines away from the President to the Provost.</p>
          <p>Another topic of interest reflected in the records are the detailed files on Indirect Cost Distributions. These papers cover the inner workings of indirect costs and how those charges are given back to the units conducting sponsored research in order to pay for various research incentives (such as the cost of GSRAs) and project costs (like telephone charges and research equipment). Finally, Robert Samors' papers highlight his work lobbying Federal and State of Michigan government officeholders on behalf of OVPR in particular and the University in general.</p>

          <p>Julie Ellison served for three years as Associate Vice-President of Research, from approximately 1996-1999. Her responsibilities within the vice-presidency included administering the Year of Humanities and the Arts (YoHA) and the Michigan Humanities and Arts Awards; providing oversight to the Middle English Dictionary and the Middle English Compendium; and monitoring multicultural affairs.</p>
          <p>The Julie Ellison Files, 1993-2000 (2.0 linear feet), are particularly strong in the revealing humanities-related issues in the late 1990s, and demonstrate the growing interest in interdisciplinary research as a worthy research goal. As the researcher will note, some of the files in this series contain records created prior to Ellison’s arrival within the vice-presidency, and were likely passed along to Ellison for her reference in assuming her new duties. Ellison also served as a professor of English language and literature at the university.</p>

          <p>Marvin Parnes served as an OVPR staff member during most of the 1980s and 1990s, an Assistant Vice President for Research during much of the 1990s, and (Interim?) head of DRDA during some of the mid-1990s. The Marvin Parnes Files, 1981-1999 (9.0 linear feet) are related to both the Central Files and the OVPR Staff Topical Files, with topics that overlap in subject matter, if not scope, with topics in each of those series.</p>

          <p>The OVPR Budget and Financial Files, 1966-1999 (3.0 linear feet), provide insight into the manner in which the OVPR allocated funding amongst its reporting units and the changing priorities within the organization over the years. Of particular interest to the researcher are the Budget Conferences, Proposals, and Presentations Files, which are arranged by fiscal year and include requests from individual units for funding, statements of priority within the organization, strategizing for the annual budget meeting with the Provost, and commitments to various programs and endeavors. While the files are arranged by fiscal year (July 1 to June 30), there are, in some cases, earlier and later records included as background for preparing budget or for wrapping up the prior fiscal year. The researcher should also note that while some reporting units do not have a separate file for each year, in many cases, related documentation was maintained in the general budgetary file for that fiscal year.</p>

            <p>The Biological Research Review Committee (BRRC) (1 linear foot), which was Committee C of CIVS (Collegiate Institute for Values and Science), was the NIH-mandated oversight committee for recombinant DNA on campus. Formed in a period of intense controversy over the risks and benefits of genetic research, the BRRC responded to public debate on the matter in addition to performing its main task of monitoring university laboratories engaged in such research. In the mid 1980s, as genetic research became more routine, the committee's work slowed down; it met less frequently and 'annual' reports were compiled only every two to three years. This led to a review of the BRRC and eventually to its being retargeted towards human gene therapy research. The later records reflect this change of focus. For more information, background, and committee records, also see the CIVS record group.</p>

            <p>The Classified and Controversial Research (3 linear feet) series consists of three subseries: 1) The records of the Ad Hoc Committee on Classified Research, also known as the 'Converse Committee', including reports reflecting the majority and minority opinions of the committee. 2) OVPR files relating to this committee, the situation that precipitated its formation, and the follow-through actions taken regarding its reports. (These records are mostly records of Linda Wilson and Judy Nowack.) 3) Records relating to ongoing classified and controversial research.</p>
            <p>The decisions of the Classified Research Review Panel of the RPC (Research Policy Committee) to accept or reject various proposals by Professors Birdsall, Sinnott, Tanter, et al. led the Regents to call for a review of the University's Classified Research Policy; this in turn led to the formation of the Ad Hoc Committee. Of particular note was Professor Tanter's proposal, which would have studied the ways in which countries negotiated treaties such as those resulting from arms control talks. This proposal was rejected due to the sponsor's (i.e. the Federal Government's) imposition of restrictions and delays on the publication of results. The debate touched on a number of issues, including the openness of research results (and whether any sponsor-demanded restrictions or delays on the publication of results was permissible), the academic-freedom rights of professors to engage in classified and/or military-related research, proprietary research, and the propriety of military research (including Strategic Defense Initiative--aka 'Star Wars'--research) by universities in general.</p>
            <p>Individuals prominent in the records include Professor Philip Converse, Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee; Howard F. Finkbeiner, Associate/Assistant within the OVPR during the mid 80s; and Ingrid Kock, an anti-classified research activist, a student member of the Converse Committee and the MSA's military researcher of the time. The GAO Survey on Department of Defense Labs was the result of an investigation called for by Carl Levin into the oversight of DoD-sponsored research on chemical and biological warfare.</p>

            <p>The records in the GSRA Task Forces (1 linear foot) series reflect several (roughly chronological) waves of activity relating to the status and compensation of graduate student research assistants on campus. Over the years, the various task forces and committees assigned to this area were influenced both by changes in the collective bargaining agreements signed by the Graduate Employee Organization (GEO) and by changes in Federal laws on the taxation of scholarships, tuition reimbursements, and stipends, as well as on cost reporting of federally-supported research. As such, the records include material both on negotiations with (and pressure from) GEO regarding GSRA compensation and on concern from faculty that previously-covered assistant positions would come up short of funding.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Research Policies Committee (RPC) (3.5 linear feet in 2002 accession) is an advisory council of the University's Senate Assembly as mandated in the Regents Bylaws. The series reflects several particular interesting aspects of the committee. The records from 1971, during which the RPC held several special summer sessions (and worked in close concert with the Classified Research Committee) to review the University's policies on accepting classified research. Also, OVPR Associate Vice President Alan Price wrote his own set of notes on each meeting, separate from the regular meeting minutes. Finally, the series contains most of the documents distributed to the committee during the period 1988-2000. The record keepers (primarily Judy Nowack, OVPR Research Policy Advisor--circa 1989--and later Assistant VP for Research, circa 1996) conveniently labeled these documents with the date of the meeting they accompanied and the agenda item number to which they referred.</p>
            <p>The 2009 addition to the Research Policies Committee (RPC) sub-series is primarily made up of General Files containing correspondence, minutes, procedures, and other assorted materials. There are also files on promotion procedures for research scientist, and the RPC retreat. The RPC is an advisory council of the University's Senate Assembly, and advises and consults with the Vice President for Research on matters of research and research personnel (http://www.umich.edu/~sacua/rpcindex.html). Researchers should refer to earlier OVPR accessions for additional materials.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (1 linear foot) is appointed by the President to oversee and monitor the University's animal care program, facilities, and procedures. As such, its responsibilities include reviewing applications for the use of animals in research, training, or testing, updating university policies for the treatment of animals, inspecting animal facilities in accordance with these policies, and advising the OVPR on matters related to the use of animals in research and education. The Committee also serves to ensure UM compliance with Federal animal welfare regulations.</p>
            <p>The records of the Committee, compiled by Judy Nowack, consist primarily of the papers (agendas, meeting minutes, and enclosures) distributed to the committee during the period 1995-1997. It also includes the Committee's Semi-Annual Reports to the Vice President for Research for the same time period; of these, the December 1995 report is accompanied by its appendices and supporting documents.</p>
            <p>The 2009 addition to the sub-series consists of reports, statements, and correspondence. The sub-series contains several UCUCA semi-annual reports dating from 1994-2005, but with some gaps. The UCUCA is responsible for monitoring animal care and use at the University, and acts as an advisor to the OVPR. Additional materials may be found in earlier accessions, and in the UCUCA records collection.</p>

          <p>The Primary Research Staff (1 linear foot) series comes mostly from the records of Sandy Whitesell. The records consist of three main 'chunks' of documents: the initial 1987-1990 PRS project (which resulted in an addendum to the faculty handbook) and its background material, the 1989-1991 survey and report comparing the handling of PRS issues at various UM-peer institutions, and ongoing (post 1991) PRS issues.</p>

          <p>The Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project (2 linear feet) was formed after the Second World War to commemorate the University's war dead by conducting research into the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Ford Nuclear Reactor is one of a number of project foci. The records in the OVPR collection reflect continuing inquiry into the safety of and need for the campus nuclear reactor. To this end, the unit underwent a number of internal and external reviews, which paid close attention to incidents at the reactor and to strategies for its possible decommissioning in the future. For more information, background, and project records, also see the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project collection.</p>
          <p>A 2009 addition to the series contains reviews, reports, and various committee materials, including documents from the Safety Review Committee and the Research Advisory Committee. Of particular interest are materials on decommissioning the Ford Nuclear Reactor (FNR). These materials can be found in the files on the Decommissioning Team, and the Decommissioning Impact Subcommittee. A few of the documents in these files mention the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11) as a factor in considering decommissioning the FNR, though it is not the only factor. For additional materials, researchers should also refer to the following collections: Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project records; and Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project publications.</p>

          <p>OVPR Special Events, Symposia, and Promotional (3 linear feet) includes the records of various OVPR-sponsored symposia and lecture series relating to national research policies and priorities, as well as those of OVPR presentations and functions. The Year of Humanities and Arts (YoHA) files come mostly from Julie Ellison, Professor of English and Associate VP for Research (specializing in the Arts and Humanities) at the time (1996-1998). The rest of the files come mostly from Lee C. Katterman, the OVPR Senior Science Writer. Where noted, a (VHS) video of the event is also in the OVPR files. This series also includes the files for the Michigan Arts and Humanities Awards (1 linear foot).</p>
          <p>The 2009 addition to the series includes two subseries: Distinguished Lecture Series, 1994-1999; and Wiesner Symposium, 1996-1999. Both subseries are organized chronologically, and include articles on the events, posters, copies of lecture and/or remarks form the events, and several of the files include photographs.</p>

          <p>The Presidential Initiatives Fund Records (9.5 linear feet) cover the many aspects of the administration of that award program. In 1986, President Shapiro applied to the W.C. Kellogg Foundation for a grant to promote inventive interdisciplinary research and innovative teaching and learning environments at the University. Kellogg responded with a grant for a five year, five million dollar to implement a Presidential Initiatives Fund (PIF) program at UM, which the University matched with an additional five million dollars. After a three-year extension to the original Kellogg grant, the University continued PIF as a program of its own.</p>
          <p>The Office of the Vice President for Research had oversight responsibility for the administration of these funds, and reported to the President's Office and the Kellogg Foundation on the program's accomplishments. Much of this responsibility fell to Assistant VP Marvin Parnes, who compiled these records. Nevertheless, the President's Office had great say in the process of awarding the grants to faculty, playing an active role in reviewing and selecting grantees. Moreover, while funds in the first few years of the program were granted in open competition, during the program years of around 1989-1994 the President hand-picked award topics and program directions based on conversations with deans, directors, and the OVPR. After this interlude, OVPR returned the granting of PIF awards to an open competition.</p>
          <p>The highest-level overview of the PIF program can be found in the first sub-series, which consists of the correspondence between the W.C. Kellogg Foundation and the University, including OVPR's annual reports assessing the program's accomplishments and impact on the University.</p>
          <p>The second sub-series, OVPR Grant Administration, details the process of managing the awards, including how the projects were requested, reviewed, and selected. This sub-series highlights changes in the direction of the program over the years. The OVPR Grant Administration records also include all of the original proposals for the open-competition phases of the PIF program, as well as the reviewers' comments on and rankings of the proposals. These proposals and comments provide insight into the breadth of and popular trends in research ideas at the University during the mid 80s through the mid 90s.</p>
          <p>Finally, those wishing to get an in-depth view of the research and instructional projects sponsored by the PIF program should examine the third sub-series, comprised of the individual project files.</p>

            <p>The Contractual Restrictions Requests (PAF_R's), 1987-2005 series consists of "Request for Approval for Contractual Restrictions on Research." (The forms are now known as PAF-R's, and were previously known as 7679R's). The requests are organized according to fiscal year. Many of the requests concern classified research. Also included in this series are copies of Regental Research Policies. These policies outline how the University engages in classified research, and under what circumstances. The files titled "Volakis" contain materials on a dispute between the University and the United States Air Force concerning restrictions the Air Force wanted to place on a research contract with the University. The project under dispute was led by UM Professor John L. Volakis. Researchers should also consult the Classified and Controversial Research, 1971-1999 sub-series for further materials on classified research projects and policies.</p>

          <p>The Michigan Life Sciences Corriidor (MLSC) series focuses on the MLSC, an initiative in biotechnology that invests in biotech research at the University of Michigan (UM), Michigan State University (MSU), Wayne State University (WSU), and the VanAndel Institute in Grand Rapids. This series is made up of three sub-series: General Files; Core Technology Alliance (CTA); and the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor Fund (MLSC Fund; MLSCF).</p>
          <p>The General Files sub-series is the smallest of the three sub-series, and contains budget and miscellaneous materials related to the business and functions of the MLSC. This sub-series also contains some correspondence, and Steering Committee meeting materials.</p>
          <p>The Core Technology Alliance (CTA), 2000-2006 sub-series contains materials on the CTA Corporation. "The CTA Corporation is a not-for-profit non-stock membership organization owned equally by founding members Michigan State University (MSU), the University of Michigan (UM), Wayne State University (WSU), and the VanAndel Research Institute as well as non-founding members Western Michigan University (WMU), Kalamazoo Valley Community College, and Grand Valley State University (GVSU). It enables coordinated scientific leadership, marketing, strategic planning, and decision-making across the core facilities (http://www.ctaalliance.org)." The sub-series includes Board of Directors meeting materials, a long run of Executive Committee meeting materials, and correspondence. It also includes reports and studies such as Progress Reports, and the Anderson Economic Impact Study.</p>
          <p>The Michigan Life Sciences Corridor Fund (MLSC Fund; MLSCF), 2000-2002 sub-series primarily consists of a proposal entitled "Infrastructure for the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor." The proposal is divided into eleven sections and an appendix, and includes material on the organization of various centers and consortiums included in the MLSC. Also included are a presentation to Interim President B. Joseph White, and requests for proposals (RFP's).</p>
