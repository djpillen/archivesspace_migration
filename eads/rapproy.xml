    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Born on March 25, 1926 in New York, New York, Roy Abraham Rappaport obtained a B.S. in Hotel Administration from Cornell University in 1949. He owned and operated Avaloch Inn in Lenox, Massachusetts from 1951 to 1959. Returning to school, he obtained a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Columbia University in 1966, performing field work in Mo'orea, Society Islands and New Guinea. Rappaport joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1965, where he stayed until his death in 1997. Rappaport was chairman of the Department of Anthropology from 1975 to 1980 and president of the American Anthropological Association from 1987 to 1989.</p>
      <p>Rappaport's first book, Pigs for the Ancestors, was published in 1968. Based on his ethnographic field work in New Guinea, it established his reputation as an internationally respected scholar. Throughout his career, much of Rappaport's work focused on the study of religion, and more specifically the relationships among religion, society, and ecology. He wrote four books and more than 60 articles, reviews, and book chapters. Rappaport also worked to direct anthropology toward policy issues and he himself consulted on issues related to the social impact of outer continental oil drilling and nuclear waste disposal. His last years were spent working on a book titled <title render="italic">Holiness and Humanity</title>, which was published posthumously in 1999.</p>
      <p>Known to his friends as "Skip," Rappaport had a generous spirit and was supportive and encouraging to his students and his colleagues. Many of those who knew him considered him brilliant; "the top of your head is better than the inside of most" a colleague once wrote him. At the time of his death from lung cancer in 1997, he was survived by his wife Ann and two daughters, Amelia and Gina.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Roy A. Rappaport papers provide a glimpse into the active life of an internationally renown and intellectually rigorous anthropologist. Organized into seven series, Biographical Files, Correspondence, Writings, Speeches and Lectures, Classes and Teaching, Consulting, and Topical Files, the papers span the years 1959 to 1997. The strength of the collection is in its documentation of Rappaport's professional and teaching activities. Rappaport's interests in environmental issues, religion, and the application of his knowledge and interests to societal issues are also evident in this collection. The researcher should note that certain aspects of Rappaport's professional career (such as his field work in New Guinea and his time as president of the American Anthropological Association) have a very limited coverage within the collection, in part because field notes and material related to the American Anthropological Association were given to other institutions. Rappaport's field notes are located at the University of California San Diego and his correspondence relating to the American Anthropological Association is at the Smithsonian.</p>

          <p>The Biographical Files series documents a more personal side of Rappaport's professional life. It contains his yearly review memos for the University of Michigan, which document his professional achievements and personal involvement with various classes and committees at the university. Also of note are transcripts of three interviews conducted with Rappaport towards the end of his life; the interviewers were Sjoerd Jaarsma of the Netherlands, Janet McIntosh, and Tom Fricke. Correspondence and other materials from a 1997 Society for Applied Anthropology tribute session for Rappaport are included here as well, and help to show the influence he had on his colleagues and former students.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series contains correspondence primarily to and from Rappaport's former students and his colleagues within the Anthropological community. In order to preserve the order of the material as closely as possible to the organizational schemes used by Rappaport, the series has been divided into two subseries: Chronological and Alphabetical. The first subseries has been arranged chronologically by year, and the second has been arranged alphabetically by the individual correspondent's last name. The researcher in search of correspondence between Rappaport and a specific individual should note that it may be necessary to look in both subseries to find the complete record of correspondence. Of particular interest is his correspondence with Derek Freeman, which began shortly after the 1983 publication of Freeman's book <title render="italic">Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth</title>, which challenged Mead's research and conclusions from her fieldwork in Samoa. As a former student and friend of Mead's, Rappaport defended her work both publicly in articles responding to Freeman's challenges, as well as privately in their correspondence. Rappaport's correspondence with his colleagues from the university's Department of Anthropology (such as Ray Kelly, Norma Diamond, and Aram Yengoyan), as well as his correspondence with his former students (like Ellen Messer and Jan Swearingen), are also rich sources of information about both the internal workings of the department and Rappaport's personal and professional life.</p>

          <p>The Writings series contains two subseries: Columbia and Articles, Papers, and Books. The Columbia subseries includes writings and related materials from the various classes that Rappaport took at Columbia. Of particular interest is the material from a class he took with Margaret Mead in 1960, "Methods and Problems in Anthropology," as it contains the notes and reports from his first field work experiences. The Articles, Papers, and Books subseries contains correspondence between Rappaport and various publishers, as well as reprints of several of the articles. Overall, this series provides good documentation of Rappaport's changing interests.</p>

          <p>The Classes and Teaching series includes syllabi, exams, lectures, and notes from several classes Rappaport taught. The majority of the records come from his time at the University of Michigan, but there is also some material from his early teaching experience as a doctoral student at Columbia, as well as from a few of the institutions where he was a guest lecturer. The care and thought with which he approached his students is evident in this series. It is also possible, through various versions of lectures, to trace how Rappaport's presentation of specific ideas changed over time. The student papers included in this collection demonstrate the level of interaction Rappaport had with his students and the respect he had for their ideas.</p>

          <p>The Consulting series contains three subseries: Academic Programs, Environmental Projects, and Miscellaneous. The Academic Programs subseries includes material from anthropology department and program reviews that Rappaport participated in for several universities. The Environmental Projects subseries documents Rappaport's belief that anthropological perspectives could contribute to social issues, and includes materials from Rappaport's involvement in nuclear waste issues in Nevada. The Miscellaneous subseries contains correspondence from various other consulting jobs, including the reorganization of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's anthropology exhibits.</p>

          <p>The last series, Topical Files, documents Rappaport's involvement in the Department of Anthropology, the University of Michigan community, and many of the other groups he belonged to outside of the university (like the American Anthropological Association). The material about the university's Studies in Religion program is particularly rich. Also of note are the records regarding the making of a film about Margaret Mead entitled "Margaret Mead: An Observer Observed."</p>
