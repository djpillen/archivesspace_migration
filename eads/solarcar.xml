      <p>In November 1987, General Motors won the Australian World Solar Challenge, a two-day solar car race on public roads testing alternative-fuel vehicles, with its vehicle <emph render="italic">Sunraycer</emph>. In July 1990, rather than building another car, GM sponsored a race of its own, GM Sunrayce USA, in which 32 North American schools drove an eleven-day route from Florida to Michigan. The top three qualifiers were partially supported by GM to compete in the November 1990 World Solar Challenge, a 1,900-mile race through Australia.</p>
      <p>The University of Michigan Solar Car Team formed in the spring of 1989 in response to GM's request for participants, and included students of engineering, business, art and journalism. The team's entry <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph>, designed, built and tested in 18 months, took first place in the GM Sunrayce, earning a spot in the World Solar Challenge. The team competed against 36 cars in Australia, including those of Japanese automakers and the faculty of the Swiss Engineering School of Biel. <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> placed third overall and first among American entries.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> team carried out administrative and technical duties. Administrative groups managed finance, logistics and publicity. Technical groups were responsible for body structure (frame, suspension and steering), chassis (driveline: wheels, hubs, tires and brakes), exterior (vehicle shell and solar collection efficiency), interior (cockpit area, instrument panel and driver controls), power electronics (control subsystem, instrumentation, and telemetry), race strategy, and solar cells.</p>
      <p>The second-generation Solar Car Team competed against 35 other North American colleges and universities in Sunrayce USA 93, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The seven-day race, held in June 1993, covered approximately 1,000 miles from Texas to Minnesota. University of Michigan's new entry <emph render="italic">Maize &amp; Blue</emph>, finished in first place, securing the team's second national championship and the opportunity to compete again in the World Solar Challenge. The team came in 11th place out of more than 50 teams in Australia, after experiencing difficulties with <emph render="italic">Maize &amp; Blue's</emph> solar array.</p>
      <p>This team's structure differed from that of the original team. Students worked in eight project teams: Aerodynamics/Body, Business (Fundraising/Public Relations and Logistics/Finance), Chassis, Computers, Power Electronics, Race Strategy, Solar Cells and Systems/Engineering. Project teams were overseen by the project manager, faculty advisor and executive committee.</p>
      <p>Development of <emph render="italic">Solar Vision</emph> began in 1993. It competed in Sunrayce 95, but was forced to withdraw after day four due to a serious accident on the road attributed to advanced technologies employed in <emph render="italic">Solar Vision's</emph> design.</p>
      <p>The university continued its tradition of solar car racing with <emph render="italic">Wolverine</emph>, taking sixth place in Sunrayce 97; <emph render="italic">MaizeBlaze</emph> placing 17th in Sunrayce 99 and 9th place in the 1999 World Solar Challenge; <emph render="italic">M-Pulse</emph>, winning the 2001 American Solar Challenge and taking third place in the World Solar Challenge; <emph render="italic">SpectruM</emph>, was not able to compete in the 2003 American Solar Challenge or the World Solar Challenge 2003 due to mechanical problems that occurred during qualifying; <emph render="italic">Momentum</emph>, winning the 2005 North American Solar Challenge and placing third in the World Solar Challenge 2005; <emph render="italic">Continuum</emph>, which will compete in the 2007 World Solar Challenge in Australia. The tenth generation solar car <emph render="italic">Infinium</emph> 2009 was unveiled in June of 2009 and raced in the World Solar Challenge in October of 2009.</p>

      <p>The records of the various U-M Solar Car projects have been received in multiple accessions and are generally described by accession. Accessions are typically organized around specific vehicles, but do contain material carried over from previous cars and races reflecting the fact that students learned from and built on the work of previous teams. For this reason, researchers are advised to review all accessions. The records contain a wide variety of documentation on the design, building, financing and racing of the solar cars and administrative and project management records.</p>
      <p>Records include group reports; topical files; and binders containing newsletters and bulletins, and administrative and technical information for the cars; also included are videocassettes detailing design, building, and racing of the Sunrunner solar-powered automobile; photographs and albums of snapshots of team members performing general team tasks and captures of the Solar Car Team website.</p>

          <p>The 1992 Accession of records of the University of Michigan Solar Car Team (4 linear feet) dates from 1989 to 1993 and consists of Visual Materials (videos and a photo album), a series of Binders, student end-of-term Group Reports, and Topical Files (from the Solar Car Team's filing cabinet).</p>
          <p>There are two videos within the Visual Materials subseries. <emph render="italic">The Making of Sunrunner</emph> by George Bournias summarizes the creation of <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> and details student participation in the project. The second video is actually a combination of two slide programs: Cut 1: The Sunrunner Down Under and Cut 2: USA and Australia Slide Program. The subseries also includes a photo album containing pictures of team members performing different tasks. Only a small number of the photographs in the album are labeled.</p>
          <p>The Binder subseries includes a set of five binders (1 linear foot) maintained by Frank E. Stagg, exterior design group leader. Covering the years 1989 and 1990, these "Sunrunner Books" contain newsletters and bulletins, lecture notes, timelines, budget and sponsor information, wind tunnel data, exterior group agendas, work schedules and weekly goals, Australia race rules and general correspondence.</p>
          <p>Also part of this subseries are the "Team Binders" (1 linear foot). These are arranged alphabetically by team function and also date from 1989 to 1990. These materials provide insight into the creation of <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph>, highlighting design concepts and testing results.</p>
          <p>The Group Reports subseries (1 linear foot) is also arranged alphabetically by team function. This series (dating from 1989 to 1990) includes bound and unbound reports. The level of student reporting ranges from the general "what I learned on this project" to very detailed reports with charts, graphs, and accounts of individual accomplishments.</p>
          <p>The Topical Files subseries (.75 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically and consists primarily of materials from the solar car team office filing cabinet. Materials in this series (dating from 1989 to 1990) include lecture notes from Aero Viroment, student applications and biographies, GM Sunrayce USA and World Solar Challenge information, meeting minutes, newsletters and bulletins. Also a part of this series is information relating to a student history project completed in 2001 examining the solar car team from its beginnings in 1989. Included is their final paper and correspondence with former team members about their experiences with the project.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The accession of files covering additions received between 2000-2001, is arranged in eight subseries, one of Visual Materials; six others by project name: Sunrunner (1990), Maize &amp; Blue (1993), Solar Vision (1995), Wolverine (1997), MaizeBlaze (1999) and M-Pulse (2001); and the team's Website as captured in 2000. In some cases, documentation received in these accessions overlaps with prior accessions. For example, additional material on <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> and <emph render="italic">Maize &amp; Blue</emph> extends what is found in prior subseries and accessions.</p>
          <p>Visual Materials subseries (1.4 linear feet) include videocassettes from the first three car projects (<emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph>, <emph render="italic">Maize &amp; Blue</emph> and <emph render="italic">Solar Vision</emph>) as well as photographs of <emph render="italic">Solar Vision</emph> and Sunrayce 95. <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> videos show construction of the vehicle and the team in the winner's circle at Sunrayce USA. A subseries of five tapes documents a visit by George Ettenheim, director of Sunrayce USA and member of General Motor's <emph render="italic">Sunraycer</emph> team, who met with the <emph render="italic">Sunrunner</emph> team to discuss strategy and planning for the race in Australia. <emph render="italic">Maize &amp; Blue</emph> videos include both unedited tape of construction and testing of the car and surveys of the race route as well as edited footage about the project and the race itself. <emph render="italic">Solar Vision</emph> videos include professionally edited tapes of Sunrayce 95 and its results and a selection of tapes containing footage of the race route during the race. Photographs of this vehicle document construction of <emph render="italic">Solar Vision</emph>, scrutineering, qualifying runs and the race itself.</p>
          <p>Sunrunner (1990) subseries (1 linear foot) contains correspondence with sponsors, supporters, Sunrayce officials and others as well as general information about the vehicle's design and members of the team. Group files include, for the most part, agendas and timelines not found in previous accessions as well as some design information. Also of interest in this subseries are files relating to both Sunrayce USA and the World Solar Challenge, including pre-race preparations, updates on race progress and memorabilia.</p>
          <p>Maize &amp; Blue (1993) (.2 linear feet) includes a small amount of information about administrative and design issues. Most of the documents relating to this vehicle, however, can be found in the materials accessioned in 1994.</p>
          <p>Solar Vision (1995) (.8 linear feet) contains files from the various design teams as well as those compiled by a mechanical engineering class whose task it was to design a jack for the solar car. Also included is information about the team itself.</p>
          <p>Wolverine (1997) (.4 linear feet) also contains files pertaining to the design and testing of this vehicle and sponsor information.</p>
          <p>The Maize &amp; Blue (1999) and M-Pulse (2001) subseries (.1 linear feet) contain very limited information regarding these projects, but it is expected that more thorough documentation will be accessioned at a future date.</p>

          <p>This accession is arranged alphabetically, which is how the records were originally kept by the solar car team. The Solar Vision subseries (1 linear ft.) has information on corporate sponsorships for the Solar Vision (1995) race team. Other files interspersed throughout have information on the car, team communications, and race information. Four files with information on Maize and Blue, the 1993 entry, have been place in Box 12 with other records pertaining to that year's car. These include pictures of the team and car, press releases, and Sunrayce 1993. the Student Papers subseries consists of papers written by student project members on varying subjects dealing with engineering aspects of the solar car. The papers were written for different classes, mostly Mechanical Engineering (ME) 490 the independent study class, within the school of Engineering pertaining to the solar car team from 1989 to 1999. Some of the student papers deal with meetings, team goals, and team evaluations. Access to the student papers is restricted under FERPA regulations.</p>

Content of links external to the University of Michigan has not been included in the website subseries, though a citation to the original Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be found within the content of the digital records.</p>
          <p>The website includes information for public dissemination on Solar Car teams, sponsors, and races. Six of the Solar Car Teams are represented in the website: Sunrunner, Maize &amp; Blue, Solar Vision, Wolverine, MaizeBlaze, and MPulse. Though documentation is available in varying degrees for each team, most team pages include information on the team members, the technical specifications for that team's car, team sponsors, and an extensive collection of photographs of races and events in which the team participated. Of particular interest are the pages for the MaizeBlaze team, which include audio and journal accounts from race team members for the team's entry in the World Solar Challenge.</p>
          <p>The website also includes year-by-year information on the Solar Car Team's participation in two major races, the GM Sunrayce and the World Solar Challenge, information for visitors about building solar cars and sponsoring the team, and issues of the team's monthly newsletter. A large number of thumbnail and full-size digitized photographs and digital images, mainly of team members and team activities, are also included.</p>
          <p>The Website 2006-2009 subseries features a snapshot of the Solar Car Team's website (http://solarcar.engin.umich.edu/). The website snapshot was harvested by the University Archives staff in April 2009 using the software HTTrack website copier downloaded from: http://www.httrack.com/. The website includes information on the current solar car Infinium (2009). The website is divided into news, sponsors, recruitment information, about us, donation information, and multimedia sections. Information regarding past teams and cars is small. The multimedia section features photographs from 2006 to present of the team, races, and cars. The website is in Drupal; an open source software package freely available for publishing, managing, and organizing a website (http://drupal.org). Blogs are heavily used on the website and the different sections are posted to in a blog format, chronologically from the top down.</p>
