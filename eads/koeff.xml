    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Steve T. Koeff (1928-2002) was born and raised in Flint, Michigan. He received his B.S. and M.D. degrees from the University of Michigan and completed his residency at the University of Michigan, where he was chief resident during 1956-1957. He completed his internship at Chicago Presbyterian Hospital and his fellowship training in neonatology at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Koeff was part of the neonatal staff of Wayne County General Hospital, affiliated with the University of Michigan, from 1965 to 1985. During this time, he developed teaching programs for both medical students and hospital staff. When the hospital closed in 1985, his work focused more on the university environment. He later became a pediatrician at the Plymouth Health Center, an affiliate of the University Health System. Koeff was able to supervise interns while also seeing patients at the Plymouth Site.</p>
      <p>Dr. Koeff was a caring and compassionate doctor and teacher throughout his career. Above all, he was dedicated to the well-being of his patients and made sure they were treated with dignity. He outwardly objected to staff treating patients as training objects rather than people. Koeff was also concerned about the cost of medical procedures and the social conditions of his patients.</p>
      <p>Koeff became unofficial historian of the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases. He kept copies of numerous departmental publications and procedural documents. Koeff was known around the department as the person who knew everything about pediatrics at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Dr. Koeff's dedication to pediatrics made him well loved by staff and students. He was awarded the first Department of Pediatrics Teaching Award in 1978. Many students kept in contact with him after leaving the medical school. His joy of teaching comes across in a statement from a 1997 self-assessment (located in Annual Reports/Curriculum Vitae, 1994-1999): "Because of my age I am frequently asked, 'Why don't you retire and do the things you really love to do?' My response is always, 'If I retire, I couldn't not do those things I would most want to do!'" Dr. Koeff taught and practiced medicine until his death in 2002.</p>

      <p>Steve Koeff's papers were removed from his office at the Medical School shortly after his passing. He collected many departmental and medical center publications. These were transferred to the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases Publications record group retained at the Bentley Historical Library. The remaining papers were divided into five series including: Department of Pediatrics, Pediatrics Curriculum and Counseling, Professional Activities, Teaching Materials and Lectures, and Visual Materials.</p>

          <p>The Teaching Materials and Lectures (1960-1993, 0.4 linear feet) series contains notes and presentations from some of his classes. Introduction to Clinical Skills 510/511: Physical Examination contains particularly rich information about the "Visit a Doctor's Examining Room" Program. Koeff would invite local preschool children to visit a doctor's office and play with instruments and interact with medical students. It was his way of introducing both the children to a comfortable medical environment and getting medical students acquainted with children. The folders contain many cards from the participating children. The series also contains text and notes from many of his lectures to colleges and professional societies.</p>
