      <p>Twins Alice and Jessie Bourquin were born in Muskegon, Michigan in 1909. Their father James, president of Continental Motors, moved the family to Grosse Pointe the next year. At his death in 1923 the Bourquins moved to Hillwood, the family property in Ann Arbor which had been used on week-ends and vacations. Alice and Jessie attended the University of Michigan, taking classes in languages, the arts, and literature while earning teaching certificates in French. A course in landscape design taught by Aubrey Tealdi appealed to their love of art and nature, inspiring them to take city planning courses at the Sorbonne in Paris after graduation and to earn master's degrees in landscape design from the University of Michigan in 1934.</p>
      <p>They began a private landscape design practice in Ann Arbor that same year, but found clients scarce due to the Depression. Beginning in 1935 Alice went to work for the State Highway Department in Lansing. The first woman landscape architect hired by the highway department, she did not let minority status deter her, but went on to a 39-year career which involved assisting in the design of most of the 103 roadside parks on the Michigan state highway system. Jessie Bourquin carried on the landscape design practice alone for five years, then joined her sister in Lansing, where she went to work for the Michigan Department of Commerce as an economic research analyst. The Bourquins lived together in Lansing, retired together in 1974, and returned to the family property in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Beginning in the 1930s the sisters and their brother James had begun to subdivide and develop the family acreage on Geddes Avenue near the Arboretum. By the 1960s four subdivisions, Hillwood I-IV, had been constructed. After their retirement the Bourquins began the last phase of development on 25 hilly, wooded acres, maintaining the strict building and use restrictions which had served to preserve privacy and natural beauty throughout the property. All Hillwood residents become members of the nonprofit Hillwood Community Preserve Association, and all building exteriors, siting, and tree-cutting had to be approved by the Bourquins.</p>
      <p>For their 80th birthdays the American Society of Landscape Architects sponsored a party for the Bourquin sisters, who also received certificates of appreciation from Governor James Blanchard and the Michigan House and Senate. They continued to live on Hillwood into the 1990s in their 1985-designed "dream house."</p>
      <p>Beyond their professional lives, the twins enjoyed traveling around the United States and Europe. Neither sister ever married. Alice passed away in 1995 with Jessie following in 1999.</p>

          <p>The landscape architectural drawings series documents the sisters' Ann Arbor-based landscape design practice begun in the 1930s. This series begins with some of their student projects from graduate school at the University of Michigan followed by commissions in Ann Arbor (mainly in the 1930s and 1940s), several later design commissions from the 1940s after they had relocated to Lansing, and finally with a subseries of landscape projects undertaken for the Michigan Highway Department.</p>
          <p>Pencil and watercolor on heavyweight paper were used for most of the Student Projects from the early 1930s. This subseries consists of plans and elevation drawings for public facilities, including a teahouse, an automobile club, a military entrance, and a roadside market. Also part of this subseries are two pencil-drawn plans for a residential district of a city and two colored drawings of a playground park plan. Some of the drawings are signed by Alice or Jessie; others are not, but are obviously by the same hand(s).</p>
          <p>The bulk of the series is made up of two subseries of landscape project drawings for a number of Michigan clients in the 1930s and 1940s; one subseries documents commissions within Ann Arbor, the other covers Michigan Projects outside of the city. These drawings include general landscape plans, detailed planting plans, building elevation drawings, and some plans and sketches for garden structures such as rose arbors, summer houses, and pools. The formats include pencil drawings on tracing paper, photocopies of such drawings, and blueprints. There is some duplication of drawings in different formats.</p>
          <p>Some projects are fully documented by several drawings, while others consist of only one plan. Most of the work is by Jessie Bourquin, who carried on the practice alone after Alice relocated to Lansing in 1935. The finely detailed plans and beautifully executed drawings attest to a high level of professional skill, as well as to the assiduous attention to detail for which the Bourquins became known. Intricate planting plans include dozens of varieties of flowers, trees, and shrubs arranged in multiple beds.</p>
          <p>In addition to illustrating the sisters' professional capabilities, the Bourquins' drawings help to document the "end of an era" in Ann Arbor and other communities -- the decline of the leisured, aristocratic estate lifestyle of the well-to-do in early twentieth century America. The Bourquins ended their practice and sought new careers as the Depression dampened demand for luxuries like landscaping, and after World War II different, less elaborate architectural tastes came to the fore.</p>

          <p>The Photographs and other visual materials series (1910-1941; 1.25 linear feet) documents the Bourquins from babyhood through their early career and includes albums of their travels to Florida and Europe, as well as professional folio prints of Jessie's private work for such notables as Alexander Dow and former University of Michigan President Alexander Ruthven. Also of interest are the various candid shots of Michigan and Ann Arbor landscaping and gardening in the 1930s. Included are photos of National Socialist architecture accumulated by their brother James Bourqin during his wartime service.</p>
