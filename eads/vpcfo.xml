      <p>Along with the president and provost, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer shares responsibility for the general management of the University of Michigan by providing leadership for strategic initiatives and policy development. The Board of Regents has delegated to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer broad authority to manage financial affairs. With a 2002/2003 budget of over $3.6 billion, the University of Michigan is not only an academic institution but also a major public corporation. This was not always the case.</p>
      <p>Throughout most of the nineteenth century, business operations at the University of Michigan involved rather simple bookkeeping procedures. Expenses consisted of salaries for professors and the costs of books for the library and janitorial services. A university secretary and a treasurer handled most of these financial matters. At the turn of the century, as the physical plant increased in size and as university functions expanded with the addition of many new units, the need for more sophisticated and centralized control of university finances became obvious.</p>
      <p>In 1908, Shirley Wheeler Smith was appointed Secretary of the university. Smith gradually extended centralized control over financial operations. In 1910, a new position of superintendent of buildings and grounds was established. A full-time purchasing agent was appointed in 1911. Both of these offices reported to Smith. In 1935, Smith's broad ranging responsibilities were recognized by the Regents when he was given the title of "Vice President in Charge of Business and Finance."</p>
      <p>By 1940, Smith supervised 75 persons and his office was responsible for all financial management of the university. Smith reported directly to the president and the Board of Regents. Responsibilities included accounting, purchasing, investments, cash management, buildings and grounds, and services such as printing, stores, housing, and utilities.</p>
      <p>In 1945, Shirley Smith retired and was replaced by Robert P. Briggs. In that same year, the position of secretary was made a separate one and, eventually, was relocated to the president's office. After 1945, the vice president's office experienced constant reorganization. Caused by the ever-expanding volume of university business, the reorganizations were intended to draw clear lines of administrative responsibility. In 1945, the Offices of Plant Superintendent and Non-academic Personnel were created. Also in 1945, several operating units were established as self-sustaining units such as the departments of printing, binding, and laundry. In 1947, the first full-time university attorney was named.</p>
      <p>In 1951, Robert Briggs resigned and was succeeded by Wilbur K. Pierpont. Pierpont had previously been Professor of Accounting at the University of Michigan and the University Controller. During the 1950s, the continued rapid expansion of the university led to a continuing series of organizational and staff changes to respond to these new and larger responsibilities of the business and financial staff. The whirlwind of change begun under the Briggs administration continued unabated under Pierpont. The Controller's Office and the Purchasing Department underwent major restructuring. A new parking operations unit was established in 1955 and an internal audit unit was created which would be renamed University Audits in 1966.</p>
      <p>By 1955, the North Campus development as well as other campus extensions in Ann Arbor led to the creation of the post of Assistant to the Vice President for Business and Finance. This position was first held by John McKevitt. Another assistantship, with responsibilities for general and budget services, was added in 1967 and was filled by Harlan J. Mulder, who served until 1987. When McKevitt left in 1969 his position was not filled until William Sturgis was appointed assistant in 1974. Sturgis had worked previously as an administrative assistant at the Law School and as a financial analyst in the Office of the Vice President. Sturgis was Assistant to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from 1974 until his retirement in 1991.</p>
      <p>Between 1956 and 1958, the Flint and Dearborn campuses were started and business managers were appointed for both of these units. Other subsidiary units were created and placed under the authority of the vice president. In 1959, the Office of Staff Benefits was established and in 1961 the Office of Financial Analysis was organized. During the 1960s, the growth in university related litigation led to an increase in the university attorney's staff and to the naming of a University General Counsel in 1970. Many other offices reporting to the vice president underwent similar growth or changes in function or reporting relationship. The result was a highly complex organizational structure.</p>
      <p>In 1976, Wilbur Pierpont resigned as vice president to return to teaching and was replaced by James F. Brinkerhoff as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The change in the title of the office had occurred, previously, in 1966. Brinkerhoff had been Director of the Plant Extension Department and then Associate Vice President and Director of Business Operations. Through the later part of the 1970s and into the 1980s, the rapid organizational changes of the previous years slackened and the office's structure appeared more stable. Perhaps the most important challenge faced by the Brinkerhoff administration was overseeing construction of the new university hospital in the 1980s. Careful monitoring of the financial aspects of this complicated project helped to assure the successful completion of the hospital in 1985.</p>
      <p>In 1988, James Brinkerhoff resigned and was succeeded by Farris W. Womack. Prior to coming to the University of Michigan, Womack had been Controller for the State of North Carolina and had held academic and administrative appointments at the University of North Carolina and at the University of Arkansas. Womack announced his retirement in 1996. During Womack's tenure the office was renamed as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Chandler Matthews served as interim CFO during 1997 prior to the appointment of Robert Kasdin as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Kasdin resigned in 2002 and was succeeded by Timothy Slottow.</p>
      <p>The history of the office of the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is a history of nearly constant reorganization and name changes for subordinate offices. Researchers who would like more detail regarding this history should consult <title render="italic">The University of Michigan: An Encyclopedic Survey</title>(volume I, pages 269-280 and volume VI, pages 1-108) for changes occurring up to 1975.</p>

      <p>Measuring 230 linear feet, 1 oversize folder, and 51 oversize volumes, the records of the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer document the fiscal history of the university beginning from 1909. At least since the 1950s the vice president has taken responsibility for the creation of university policy in areas requiring special fiscal knowledge as well as for the preparation of the university's general fund and trust budgets. Other activities, such as policing actual expenditures or the day to day operations of specific service units within the university reporting to the vice president, have been delegated to subordinate offices.</p>
      <p>Reflecting this division of responsibility, the records of the vice president document major fiscal issues facing the university and the preparation of the university's annual budgets. Some of the records are office files. However, the office also retained many key bound financial documents including an official set of the university's annual budgets.</p>
      <p>The records are organized into six series: Central Topical Files; Supplemental Files; Assistant to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Associate Vice President for Finance; University Budgets, Accounts and Reports; and Photographs. Most series are further divided into several subseries, reflecting different accessions. There is considerable overlap in date span of the topical files of the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Files created by one Vice President were sometimes retained for use by his successor(s) and transferred at a much later date than the bulk of his records.</p>

            <p>The 1929-1977 Topical File (1984 accession, boxes 1-25), includes records dating from 1929 to 1977, however, the bulk of this material dates between 1955 and 1975. The 25 linear feet of material is arranged in one alphabet according to subject headings devised by the office. This subseries generally documents the creation of policy in areas requiring financial expertise, such as investment or insurance, as well as the implementation of other university policies through the expenditure of funds. Major subject headings include: Budget, Capital Outlay Requests, Compensation, Fees, Gifts, Hospital, Indirect Costs, Insurance, Investment, Personnel, Plant Extension, Staff Benefits, and Willow Run. Several audits of the university and its hospital published by the state auditor are found within the vice president's records. They are located under the heading "Auditor General (State of Michigan)."</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>In 1990-1991, the Bentley Library accessioned a second subseries of Topical Files containing records from 1963 to 1988 (boxes 59-65). The bulk of this material dates from James Brinkerhoff's tenure as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (1977-1987). This topical file is arranged alphabetically and includes correspondence, memoranda, and reports. These records reflect some of the financial concerns of the university during that time period and highlight major fiscal decisions made by the university.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most significant fiscal project faced by the University of Michigan in the early 1980s was the construction of a replacement university hospital. Many of the financial planning records for the new hospital are included in the topical file under "Hospitals - Replacement University Hospital". Financial negotiations with the architects, Albert Kahn Associates, may also be found in this group of folders. (Researchers may also consult the University Hospitals record group for further information.)</p>
            <p>While not officially part of his office's responsibilities, Brinkerhoff participated in several important nationwide university consortiums. The records of his involvement in those organizations are also included in the topical files. As one of the original members of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), the University of Michigan maintained a continued interest in this significant but expensive research venture. The records of Brinkerhoff's service on several financial committees for this consortium from 1979 to 1985 may be found under AURA. Also, researchers interested in the early financial difficulties and eventual solvency of the Research Libraries Group, Inc. (RLG) should consult Brinkerhoff's records as treasurer of this consortium. (For additional materials on AURA the researcher should consult the organization's records and for additional information on RLG the researcher should consult the records of the University of Michigan Library; both record groups are available at the Bentley Historical Library.)</p>
            <p>Several other folders include material of potential research interest. "Ford Presidential Library" includes correspondence, memoranda, and meeting minutes pertaining to the efforts of university officials to locate this library in Ann Arbor. "Health Maintenance Organizations" includes correspondence and reports, beginning in 1968, regarding the feasibility of an HMO at the University of Michigan. "Public Interest Research Group in Michigan" includes information regarding the debate over check-off donations for that group as a part of student registration. Finally, those interested in the demise of the student bookstore should see "University Cellar."</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>A 1993 accession of Topical Files (Boxes 67-76) covers the years 1925-1989, with the bulk of records dating from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. The contents of this accession parallel those of boxes 59 through 65.</p>
            <p>The files document the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer's response to several major trends which affected the university during the 1970s and 1980s. First among these is the response to growing financial constraints. The impact of state budget cuts and attempts to deal with a scarcity of funds may be seen in the "Broadcasting and Media Services," "Energy Conservation," "Research," "Student Aid," and "University Press" files, while the increasing sophistication of fund-raising efforts is documented in the various "Capital Campaign" folders.</p>
            <p>The financial and administrative response to another major trend, technological change, is evident in the "Computing Center," "Information Systems Design and Optimization System Project," and "Telecommunications Planning" files.</p>
            <p>The "Labor Relations" files, some of which have been restricted for thirty years to protect the privacy of individual university employees, give a sense of the often strained relationship between labor and management, particularly during the 1970s. The "Ann Arbor/University Relations," "North Campus Planning" and "Parking" files document various issues which affected relations between the university administration and the city of Ann Arbor.</p>

            <p>The 1937-1999 topical files, accessioned in 2000, is largest to date from the Office of Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The transfer consists of 55 linear feet of alphabetically arranged Topical Files spanning the period from 1937 to 1999. The bulk of the documentation, however, falls within the years 1980-1991. The records are largely in the order and condition in which they were received, maintaining the filing conventions and terminology utilized by the office. In some cases, topics will have numerous subdivisions within the hierarchical structure. Overall, the records illuminate the university's fiscal policies, investments, properties, and policies, as well as campus-wide topics such as affirmative action, labor relations, and staff benefits.</p>

            <p>The 1951-1997 Topical File subseries, accessioned in 2003, totals just 3 linear feet of alphabetically arranged subject files. These records cover the years 1951-1997, although the bulk of the material dates between 1982 and 1997. There is considerable overlap with prior accessions so an attempt has been made to provide cross-references to related documentation in other parts of the record group when necessary. Topics documented in these files include the Business and Finance Lead Team, part of the university's M-Quality initiative to improve quality in higher education; summaries of work accomplished by various departments reporting to the vice president in the form of Reports to the President and a report to the Board of Regents, "Reflections: 1988-1993"; the university's involvement in the development of a high technology research park in Ann Arbor; and broader financial and personnel issues.</p>

As with previous accessions, however, this one also contains some older information in files that predated but were maintained during the main time frame.</p>

            <p>The Supplemental Files, 1957-2001 (bulk 1993-2003), comprise several smaller sets of topical files maintained outside of the general files, related to only a few main topics. The bulk of the files date from the tenures of Farris Womack and Robert Kasdin. One issue of particular significance from Kasdin's term was the reorganization of the university's hospital and medical center in the mid-1990s, which is documented in a series of Hospital supplemental files.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The series University Budgets, Accounts and Reports, consists of three subseries: Annual University Budget (official copy); Miscellaneous Unit Budgets (mainly University Hospital); and Project (Trust Fund) Budget.</p>
          <p>The University of Michigan has historically created not one but two university budgets. The document generally referred to as "the budget" and which records most expected university expenses is, in fact, the plan under which general fund money is allocated. The primary sources of general fund income are state taxes and appropriations, as well as tuition and other fees. The "other" budget has been known as either the "Trust Fund" or "Project" Budget. It reports the appropriations of restricted funds. Originally the most common source of restricted funds was various bequests made to the university by individuals to support specific activities or services, such as student loans or research. Thus the accounts were collectively referred to as "Trust Fund Budgets." After World War II the increasing flow of restricted funds from other sources, such as federal funding for construction and research, made the old title obsolete, and the accounts were renamed "Project Budgets."</p>
          <p>Preparation of an Annual University Budget (official copy), appears to have begun in 1909/1910 (an earlier typed budget from 1908/1909 has been listed with this series for convenience). Bound in an oversize format, this document detailed for each unit all employees, each employee's salary history over the previous five years, the requested salary for each employee, and a non-itemized figure for each of the other expenses found in the unit's budget, such as equipment or travel. Each unit's budget was signed by an authorizing official, usually the department chair or dean of the school. Space was allowed so that the authorizing official could, if desired, include a justification for budgetary increase requests. Originally, many authorizing officials did include justification for increased expenses, particularly for higher salaries, but as time passed explanations became rarer. In the last official copy of the university budget, prepared in 1946/1947, explanation had virtually disappeared.</p>
          <p>The physical awkwardness of the official copy of the budget and the need for multiple copies undoubtedly led university officials in 1919/1920 to print copies of most of the budget. Between 1919/1920 and 1947/1948 this bound record was divided into two parts. Part I, "Summary of the Budget," gave a quick overview of university general fund spending. Part II, "Salary Budget," detailed the largest item in the general fund budget. The Salary Budget omitted, however, all non-salary expenses and the optional explanation of changes.</p>
          <p>In 1948/1949 the printed budget was modified. The "Salary Budget" was retitled "Detailed Budget" and its scope was broadened. Non-salary items previously excluded, such as "Current Expense and Equipment" and "Travel" were reported, as well as a few general fund accounts which earlier had not been detailed. A growing concern over the privacy of individual salary figures, led to a major revision in the budget's format in 1956/1957. The Summary/Budget, for convenience long published as a separate document, became the only published document. In place of the Detailed Budget a new publication, called Department Payroll and Accounts, appeared. This document, which had only a limited distribution, included the salary information formerly printed in section II. This salary information also appears in the pages of the <title render="italic">Michigan Daily</title>which, relying upon legislation enacted in October 1979, defining state employees' salaries as public records, has annually published the salaries of faculty and professional and administrative employees of the university.</p>
          <p>In 1957/1958, although the Summary Budget continued to be published, a more complete publication, Proposed Budget and Supplementary Schedules was begun. It included the information found in the general fund budget, as well as information about project budgets. This new publication, referred to informally as "the grey book" because of its cover, became the basic budgetary reference tool. In 1965/1966 the volume's title was changed to Budget and Supplementary Schedules. In 1967/1968 it became known by the simple title, Budgets. In 1973/74 the grey book was divided into four volumes, one subtitled "All Campus," the other three giving the budget for each of the university's three major centers, Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint.</p>
          <p>Compared with the complexity of the publications reflecting the university's annual general fund budget, the subseries Trust Fund Budgets, is simple. It began in 1948/1949 with an oversize volume whose format resembled the official copy of the university budget. In 1950/1951 the Trust Fund Budget's format was reorganized to resemble that of the second section of the printed annual budget, the "Salary Budget." As time passed the number of project budgets became large, leading to the binding of multi-volume sets. In 1962/1963 a two volume set was produced. By 1967/1968 twelve volumes were needed to hold all of the budgets. After that year, however, the bulk was reduced and in 1973/1974 the practice of actually binding the budgets together was abandoned.</p>
          <p>In addition to this basic publication of Trust Fund/Project Budgets, the vice president's office also prepared, under various titles, Selected Project Budgets. The reason for these publications was that the budgets of major university units, such as the Institute for Social Research, were difficult to find among the many project budgets. The selected project budget publications made these major units' budgets more accessible.</p>
          <p>Auxiliary Activities, contained the records of units which were substantially self-supporting. A few departmental payroll and account volumes exist for these units, but most of the subseries is made up of annual budgets from the residence halls and University Hospital. The budgets of these two units were probably retained because they are the university's largest auxiliary activities. The hospital, for example, usually accounts for twenty to twenty-five percent of the university's total income and expenses. They are similar in form to the printed annual budget's Detailed Section. The hospital budget contains primarily salary information and also a few general financial tables. It seems to have been modeled on the older official copy of the university budget.</p>
          <p>Reports are the traditional annual accounting which is expected of a major financial institution. Originally prepared for the Regents' scrutiny, today the reports are the basic documents through which the university makes itself accountable for the receipt and expenditure of funds. Two types are generated: Financial (originally Treasurer's) and Investment. The Financial Report, and its predecessor Treasurer's Report, has been issued annually since 1883. It is published in two parts. The first offers a cursory overview of all university income and expenses regardless of the source. The second presents tables detailing income and expenses at the unit level. Because the Financial Report includes both general fund and project income and details both summary salary and non-salary expenses, it is the single most comprehensive document available regarding university finances.</p>
          <p>The Investment Report is a highly specialized document which annually details where the university has placed the funds available to it. Begun in 1928 the Investment Report historically listed the portfolio holdings of each university account. In the mid-1960s the basic structure of the document was changed. Individual accounts were no longer listed. Instead, the university's investment portfolio was reported on as a whole, although the practice of citing each investment instrument by name was retained. The new format made it clear how university funds as a whole were invested, but made it impossible to determine where the funds of a particular account were placed.</p>
          <p>The published annual budget; departmental payrolls and accounts; project budgets; auxiliary activities; reports; and state budget documents are described and located within the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer publications record group. A separate finding aid has been prepared for these documents.</p>

            <p>The Assistant to the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer topical files, measuring 8 linear feet and covering the period 1940-1988 (bulk 1960-1980) (1996 accession, boxes 77-84), was compiled by William Sturgis, who filled this position from 1974 to 1991. These files augment the main topical files received in previous accessions, but include documentation unique to the assistant position. The assistant position, held by John McKevitt, and after a gap of several years, by Sturgis, included involvement in plant extension planning, programming building space and acting as legislative liaison for building appropriations.</p>
            <p>These records cover Sturgis' tenure and include some materials from McKevitt's period (1955-1969). Sturgis kept thorough records of the many committees he sat on, particularly the plant extension committee and the faculty advisory committee to the vice president. The latter committee was formally known as the SACUA Committee on Campus Planning and Development until 1971, when the name was changed to SACUA Advisory Committee on Financial Affairs. Sturgis was secretary for this committee.</p>
            <p>Sturgis was involved with a wide range of urban planning issues affecting both Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan and was a member of the joint university-city relations committee. He was also involved with various committees concerning specific issues, including the development of North Campus, student parking, fire and security forces, housing and funding for recreational facilities. The file names created by Sturgis have been used except in a few cases where more information has been supplied, and the files are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>

            <p>The files of the Associate Vice President for Finance Topical Files (15 linear feet) date from Timothy Slottow's term in that position, 1998-2003. As with the earlier accession of files from the Assistant to the Vice President and Chief Executive Officer in 1996, these files augment the main topical files received in previous accessions, but also include documentation unique to the assistant position. One particularly interesting set of files relate to the university's investments in Information Technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
