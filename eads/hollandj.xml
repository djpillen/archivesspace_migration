      <p>John Henry Holland, a University of Michigan professor of psychology, electrical engineering, and computer science, helped pioneer the fields of artificial intelligence and the theory of complex adaptive systems. He is often called the father of genetic algorithms, having written a ground-breaking book on the subject in 1975 titled <title render="italic">Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems</title>.</p>
      <p>Holland was born on February 2, 1929, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and was raised in Ohio. He was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a B.S. in physics in 1950, and the University of Michigan, where he received a M.A. in mathematics in 1954 and was the first recipient of a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Michigan in 1959. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1959, where he received the Louis E. Levy Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1961, as well as the UM Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1987. A notable distinction in Holland's career was the bestowal of the prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1992, totaling $369,000 over a five year period.</p>
      <p>In 1961 Holland became an assistant professor in communication sciences, and was promoted to professor in 1967. He became a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in 1984 when communication sciences became part of the College of Engineering. In 1988, he was named a professor of psychology, in addition to being appointed as professor of electrical engineering and computer science. Besides working at UM, Holland served as a consultant to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and served as a member of the Board of Trustees and Science Board of the Santa Fe Institute. He was a research associate at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. and a consultant to Argonne National Laboratory, and was made a fellow of the World Economic Forum.</p>
      <p>Holland's research expanded beyond computer science and mathematics, extending into the fields of psychology and communication sciences. He was a member of the pioneering group that programmed the earliest IBM computers in the 1950s, and studied how computers can evolve in noticeably human ways. His development of the concept of genetic algorithms was groundbreaking in the fields of computer science, communication science, psychology, and biology. These algorithms refer to a set of instructions that enable a computer to essentially learn, taking what it knows and making new rules, and adapting to new circumstances. Using computer models, Holland studied the process of adaptation in complex adaptive systems ranging from human organisms to the economy. These systems, he found, are constantly evolving, changing and interacting mechanisms that control everything from how people learn, to how advanced computers process information, to global economics and politics. </p>
      <p>Holland is the author of a number of books, and has written and published countless articles and research papers.</p>

          <p>The Departmental Records series documents Holland's professorial and administrative career at the University of Michigan, spanning the years between 1961 and 1982. This is the largest series in the collection, and its records are organized thematically. The General Departmental records partly consist of memos within the Committee on the Degree Program in Communication Studies from 1961-1981, of which Holland was a member. They also contain information regarding program and course requirements, exam schedules, professorial appointments, and course structure.</p>
          <p>This series also contains documents regarding departmental budget, pertaining mostly to the School of Communication Sciences. These include memos, salary schedules, teaching load and corresponding budget information for Computer and Communication Sciences faculty members. Within this series is documentation of Holland's participation in the Center for Cognitive Science at the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan, from 1980 to 1982.</p>
          <p>Holland was a member of the Executive Committee and the Policy Committee for the Communication Studies Program, records from both of which are found in this series, dating from 1966 to 1981. These include memos, curriculum changes, Masters and PhD requirements, course and program evaluation reports, school statistics, and grading, admission, and advising guidelines.</p>
