      <p>The Residential College (RC) at the University of Michigan was inaugurated in 1967 as a living-learning community of teachers and students, to give participants an alternative to a large university experience. Early in the 1960s, the increasing enrollment in the university's College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) caused some members of the faculty to envision a school which combined the advantages of a small liberal arts college with a large research university. Dean (and later Vice President) Roger Heyns, Professor Theodore Newcomb, Professor Wilbert J. McKeachie, and LS&amp;A Dean Burton Thuma were among the planners who worked to create the new college. The Residential College was officially established as a unit by the Regents in March 1964, and the Residential College Faculty Planning Committee was formed within LS&amp;A in September 1964.</p>
      <p>Dean Burton Thuma chaired the Planning Committee and was also named Director of the Residential College, although he retired before the first class of freshmen arrived in the fall of 1967. The Planning Committee prepared extensive reports to the faculty in 1965 and 1966, and, in April 1966, earned Regental approval of the Residential College concept and curriculum. The program was scheduled to begin in the East Quadrangle in the fall of 1967, with planners looking toward occupancy of a North Campus site in the fall of 1969. This latter part of the plan, which envisioned the college on a forty-acre site between Fuller Road and the Huron River, was eventually abandoned.</p>
      <p>James Robertson became the director of the RC on July 1, 1967, and the first class of 217 freshmen matriculated in the fall. Key elements of the RC curriculum have endured from its beginnings: the freshman seminar, strong language proficiency and pass/fail grading, supplemented with textual evaluations. Early topics of concern within the community involved governance and the core curriculum. The inability of the RC to confer tenure was another difficult problem. Its powerlessness to reward instructors, coupled with financial instability, led to staffing problems. The result was such that the majority of classes were taught by teaching fellows or lecturers.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 1971, LS&amp;A Dean Frank Rhodes appointed a special committee to review the RC. Professor Rhoads Murphey chaired the committee, which produced its report in the spring of 1972. Although the report was often critical, it ended by affirming the goals and future of the RC. The LS&amp;A faculty debated the Murphey report in October 1972. The outcomes were that a joint RC/LS&amp;A Board should be established, and that the RC should be reviewed every four years. Crucial issues of financing and staffing were left unresolved.</p>
      <p>Louis Orlin took over as acting director of the RC on July 1, 1973, and served for one year, though poor health greatly inhibited his work. He was succeeded by physics professor Marc Ross, who served for three years beginning July 1, 1974, and John Mersereau, Jr., who served for eight years beginning July 1, 1977. Under Mersereau, the RC underwent its second review in 1976. The committee concluded that the RC was financially, academically, and philosophically viable. Mersereau was appointed as full-time director and was able to direct substantially more time to administration than any of the earlier directors. During Mersereau's tenure, the RC/LS&amp;A Joint Board instituted triennial curriculum reviews of each of the RC's programs, reviewed and recommended appointments and promotions, and served as a lobbying force within the LS&amp;A Executive Committee. Elizabeth Douvan was director beginning July 1, 1985, followed by Herbert Eagle in May 1988, Thomas Weisskopf July 1996, and Charles Bright in 2005, and Angela Dillard in 2011.</p>

          <p>The Administration series (6.5 linear feet, 3.7 GB (online), 1966-2010), is organized chronologically by directorships of the Residential College, beginning in 1967, as follows: James Robertson, Louis Orlin, Marc Ross, John Mersereau, Elizabeth Douvan, Herbert Eagle, Thomas Weisskopf, and Charles Bright. The records relate to curriculum, governance, student attitudes, educational policies, and campus events. Digital content (3.7 GB) includes Director Charles Bright's e-mail files, which are arranged by subject and give a day-by-day account of the activities and contacts involved in directing the college. Some of the subjects of these files include admissions, community outreach, East Quad, and business relating to the various RC programs. These files are closed for 75 years from the date of creation under the student educational records restriction. Further information on the Administration can also be found in the Topical Files.</p>

          <p>The Social Science Program series (1.0 linear foot, 1976-1991) consists of two subseries, Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE), and Student-Faculty Research Community. The FIPSE subseries contains the conceptual documents for the Student-Faculty Research Community, an educational innovation that proposed a seminar in which students and faculty members would collaborate on a social science research project, as presented in a FIPSE grant proposal. The Student-Faculty Research Community subseries contains the research reports produced by the RC social science seminars. The research reports are arranged in chronological order. Further information on the Administration can also be found in the Topical Files.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series (0.2 linear feet, 1964-1994) consists of several folders of photographs, the first containing copies of photos of RC freshman field trips to Kentucky in 1970-1972, and the second, a photo of the Residential College Faculty Planning Committee from 1967 along with an undated photograph. It also includes a folder containing copies of photos of a 1964 Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) protest at Detroit's AAA office. The provenance of the photos is unknown. Other folders include photos of faculty-student committee meetings, probably from the late 1960s, photos from the 1994 orientation, and photos of faculty members, students, social events, and East Quad.

          <p>The Audiovisual series (59 GB, 1968-2007) includes a variety of different formats, including VHS tape, EIAJ-1 videotape, Mini DVs, audio cassettes, 7" and 10.5" reel-to-reel tape, 12" vinyl records, one 8mm film reel, and digital materials from CDs/DVDs. VHS tape content includes graduations from the early 1990s, events from the college's 30th anniversary celebration in 1997, a talk by James Robertson on the origins of the Residential College, symposia, interviews, and documentaries. While most of the EIAJ-1 videotapes are unlabeled, among them are a debate on nuclear power and inaugural festivities from 1973. The Mini DVs mostly contain faculty member interviews and video recordings of events such as the East Quad Music Festival and the RC Afro-Cuban Drumming Concert. Audio cassettes include faculty interviews and Student-Faculty Research Community research design training tapes. Reel-to-reel tapes contain recordings from music classes and concerts. The vinyl records contain recordings from the East Quad Music Co-op, including the album "All who Rob and Plunder" from the band Civilian Fun Group." Digital content (59 GB) includes video files of several student/alumni-produced films; course activities, including from a Nonviolence in Action course and an Afro-Cuban drumming course; recordings created for the college's website of faculty members and students discussing their experiences in the college; and two theatrical productions, "The Struggle for Existence: Darwin's Dreams" and "Blood Wedding."</p>

          <p>The Archived Website series (205 MB, 1998-) includes captures of the Residential College website and documents the academic programs, accomplishments, resources, events, and people at the Residential College. Content includes information for prospective students explaining what RC is and what it offers as well as information for current RC community members such as faculty and staff listings, list of events, newsletters, program and course guides, graduation requirements, and student activities descriptions. The series is arranged chronologically and includes content captured by the Internet Archive starting in 1998 as well as versions from 2001, 2003, and 2007 originally stored on optical discs. The 2003 capture is from "The Art (and politics) of War" pilot sub-section of the RC website. Since 2010, this archived website has been captured on a regular, ongoing basis as part of the University of Michigan Web Archives, hosted at http://webarchives.cdlib.org/a/universityofmichigan/.</p>
