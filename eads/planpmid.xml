The records are a good source of information on the history of birth control, abortion, sex education, and women’s health issues in the state from the 1930s to the turn of the twenty first century. In addition to the Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan files, the collection includes records documenting the Planned Parenthood Association of Southwestern Michigan and Planned Parenthood of Southeast Michigan, dating from the period before these two organizations merged with Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan. Materials include board minutes and reports, correspondence, organizational handbooks and policy statements, pamphlets, newsletters, newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, photographs, and videotapes.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The Mother's Clinic, Inc., established in Detroit in 1927, was the first contraceptive clinic opened in Michigan. Shortly thereafter, individuals in other Michigan communities started local committees to disseminate information about contraception. A committee was established in Ann Arbor in 1932, followed by the opening of the Ann Arbor Maternal Health Clinic in 1935. Located in a seven-room house at 738 N. Main Street, its facilities included a living room, examining room, interview room, and lavatory. Dr. Inez Wisdom became the clinic director, an eight member board was organized, and by-laws were adopted. A three hundred dollar gift from the Ann Arbor Community Fund financed the first year of operation. The clinic was open one day a week, and serviced referrals from area health and social agencies.</p>
      <p>In 1936, many of the clinic's expenses were covered by the Ann Arbor Community Fund; however, these monies did not pay for services for rural clients. In order to provide these services, the clinic collected donations. In addition to raising funds, a Medical Advisory Board for the Ann Arbor Maternal Health Clinic was also established in 1936.</p>
      <p>Heavy use of the clinic's services demonstrated the community's need for organizations devoted to issues of birth control. In 1940, the Maternal Health League of Ann Arbor was incorporated. (The Ann Arbor Maternal Health Clinic was included in the League.) Two years later, the name "Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood, Ann Arbor Chapter" was adopted to comply with changes made by Planned Parenthood at the national and state levels. The remaining years of the 1940s saw developments in publicizing the organization's offerings. A radio series was started as well as the posting of weekly items in the Ann Arbor News. A speaker's bureau and volunteer training program were also established. In 1948, the name of the organization was changed once again to "Michigan League for Planned Parenthood, Washtenaw County".</p>
      <p>The 1950s witnessed continued expansion of the programs offered by the Michigan League for Planned Parenthood, Washtenaw County. These included marriage counseling, referral services for infertility cases, and tests for cancer. In 1954, the Michigan League for Planned Parenthood dissolved, leaving the organization affiliated with the National League only; the clinic's name changed to the Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood. In spite of these changes, clinic facilities were improved and the office enlarged. The clinic's patient load increased and clinic hours were extended to accommodate this. Another clinic was established in Ypsilanti.</p>
      <p>Increased growth and community acceptance characterized the 1960s at the Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood. The patient load increased from 695 in 1961 to 2,182 in 1968. A study of the Enovide pill was established in 1961 and continued in the following year. In 1964, the clinic's hours of operation were increased and new staff members were hired. During this year, six research projects were in process including a study of the intra-uterine device. The following year, the organization submitted a proposal to the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to implement family planning projects using outreach workers. Legislative measures allowing public health and welfare workers to initiate discussion of birth control methods with clients were also passed in 1965. These would greatly shape the clinic's future programs and services. Additionally, the family planning proposal submitted in 1965 to the OEO was approved in 1966.</p>
      <p>New programs were also established in the 1970s. The Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood established a youth program in 1972 named "Express Clinic." Express offered youth counseling on sex related topics as well as confidential pregnancy testing, medical services, and referrals. The Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood became the first Planned Parenthood affiliate to offer vasectomy services when it opened the Vasectomy Clinic in June of 1973. The addition of first-trimester abortion services in December of the same year brought changes to the clinic's structure. The number of volunteers working at the clinic was reduced by one-half at this time because of the need for professional staff to service clients seeking abortion services.</p>
      <p>The 1980s also witnessed increased programming and major changes to the organization. Recognizing that teenagers receive much of their information about sex through their peers, the Peer Education Program was established in 1981. The goal of this program was to combat misinformation about sex. In 1983, the name of the Washtenaw League for Planned Parenthood changed to Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan (PPMM). The following year, Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan moved to a new building. Although the organization had moved several times since its establishment, this new home was the first that was designed especially for the organization. In 1984, the number of patients served annually numbered 5,203, and educational services were delivered to 8,369 individuals. Groups opposing freedom of choice grew strong in the mid 1980s. As opposition to abortion increased, Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan offered opportunities for the community to explore and discuss this issue. The organization held a forum on the movie "Silent Scream" in 1985. Other activities included discussions focusing on the issues of reproductive freedom and projects to influence legislative protection of reproductive rights. In 1987, Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan experienced its first anti-abortion picket.</p>
      <p>The turn of the century saw a period of consolidation among regional chapters of Planned Parenthood. In 1969 the Twin Cities Area Planned Parenthood Association was formed to serve Berrien County, Michigan. As its area of service expanded, its name was changed to Planned Parenthood Association of Southwestern Michigan. This organization had clinics in Niles, South Haven, and Benton Harbor, and worked in cooperation with Country Family Planning clinics throughout Berrien, Cass, and Van Buren Counties. In 1998, Planned Parenthood of Southwestern Michigan merged with Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan to form Planned Parenthood Mid-Michigan Alliance. In 2007, this organization merged with Planned Parenthood of Southeast Michigan, which had served the metropolitan Detroit area since 1922. The newly formed organization was called Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Series contains records created between 1942 and 2004. This series documents the administrative workings of Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan. It has been further subdivided into six subseries. The first subseries, Annual Meeting Minutes, contains minutes from annual meetings held between 1952 and 1988. Although not every year is represented, the minutes offer an overview of the organization's activities. The Board of Directors subseries includes handbooks for individuals on the board as well as meeting minutes spanning the years 1948 through 1977. Minutes of meetings as well as the reports included in the Executive Committee subseries offer another source of information about the major issues facing Planned Parenthood. The Correspondence and Memoranda subseries includes both incoming and outgoing correspondence. The Reports and Lists subseries includes annual reports, budget information, and reports about the number and kinds of services the clinic offered. These documents offer the researcher insight into the achievements and challenges facing PPMM. They also illuminate PPMM's impact and role in the community. It should be noted that these are high level organizational reports and lists. Reports of specific committees may be found in the Committees and Departments subseries. As its title suggests, this subseries offers an overview of the committees and departments comprising PPMM. The names of the committees and departments offer information about what PPMM saw as the challenges facing them. Documents in this subseries also present detailed information about the nuts and bolts of these bodies.</p>

          <p>The Working Files series consists of documents created and collected by PPMM to inform work on specific topics. These documents span the time period between 1964 and 1995. Several subseries are of particular note. The Abortion subseries documents the rise of opposition to abortion and responses to this opposition by abortion rights activists and organizations. Two subseries pertaining to programs developed by PPMM are especially valuable. The first is the Express Teen Clinic subseries that documents this PPMM program and local reactions to it. The subseries entitled Peer Education Program describes the second initiative. Founded on the belief that teenagers get most of their information about sexuality from their peers, the Peer Education Program was developed. By educating a small group of teenagers who would in turn educate other teenagers, misinformation about sexuality could be combated. The Youth Oriented Material subseries offers further information pertaining to programs directed at teenagers. Insight into the issues surrounding family planning can be found in the subseries with this name. It includes information on family planning resources, projects, and services. The Legislative subseries documents legislative initiatives on abortion during this period. Finally, the Statistics subseries offers compiled information pertaining to the various procedures and services offered by the organization.</p>

          <p>The series entitled Individuals' Files contains records created by specific staff and board members of PPMM. This series includes files of Betty Ann Duff, who served as Executive Director from 1965 to 1969 and as Board President in 1977-1978; Deborah Oakley, a member of Board who also served on the Executive Committee in the 1970s; Nedra Otis, who was involved in the 1972 abortion law reform effort; and Molly Prendergast, who was Board President from 1969 to 1971. These records date from the 1970s and the 1990s, with a small amount of historical material dating from the late 1930s to the 1950s to be found among Deborah Oakley's files. They span a wide range of topics and complement the documents found in the other series.</p>

          <p>The Visual Materials series comprises black-and-white and color photographs taken between the 1960s and 2005. The photographs document programs and special events hosted by PPMM. Included are photographs of staff and volunteers working in clinics and participating in pro-choice events and demonstrations, and portraits of the organizations' executives and board members. There are also interior and exterior shots of some clinic facilities, and a number of images of anti-abortion protestors, mostly taken outside the Ann Arbor Planned Parenthood clinic and administrative offices. This series also includes a 1989 videotape relating to Operation Rescue, and a 1994 video of two advertising spots for the Lansing and Jackson clinics.</p>
