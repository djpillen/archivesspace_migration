    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Michel Charles Oksenberg was born October 12, 1938 in Antwerp, Belgium. He later emigrated to the United States where he was raised in Tallahassee, Florida, and where he became a naturalized citizen. Oksenberg graduated from Leon High School in Tallahassee in 1956, then went on to Swarthmore College, where he received a B.A. with honors in 1960, and then to Columbia University, where he received his M.A. in 1963 and his Ph.D. in 1969. As an undergraduate, he majored in political science, though he also studied philosophy and economics. At Columbia, he specialized in foreign political institutions (China, Japan, and the USSR) with a minor in American government. He learned Chinese and French at this time.</p>
      <p>Oksenberg began his professional career at Stanford University as acting assistant professor of political science (1966-1968). He then returned to Columbia as assistant professor (1968-1971) and later was associate professor (1971-1974) in that college's East Asian Institute. In 1973, he took on added responsibilities as adjunct associate professor at the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies, and in 1974, he was appointed associate professor at the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Oksenberg's principle interest as a scholar has been in the government and institutions of the People's Republic of China (PRC). His dissertation at Columbia concerned local and rural government in China, and he has since authored numerous articles and book reviews in the field. He traveled to China in 1964-1965, and again in 1971-1972, and while there, he studied at the Universities Service Center in Kowloon (Hong Kong) and made contacts with a number of Chinese scholars. Oksenberg made numerous subsequent trips to China.</p>
      <p>Since 1968, Oksenberg has served on both the executive committee and the board of directors of the National Committee on U.S. - China Relations. From 1970 to 1974, he was a member of the board of directors of the Association for Asian Studies, and since 1971, he has been on the Council of Foreign Relations. He has been a consultant to the Rand Corporation (1967-1973) and the Ford Foundation (1971), and was a member of the Preliminary Screening Committee of the Foreign Area Fellowship Program for Asia (1967-1971). He has served on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals, including <title render="italic">China Quarterly</title> (1970- ), <title render="italic">Chinese Law and Government</title> (1970- ), and the <title render="italic">Journal of Asian Studies</title> (1972- ). He belongs to the American Political Science Association and has participated in the Social Science Research Council (particularly its Joint Committee on Contemporary China). He has also been a managing member of the executive board of Swarthmore College.</p>
      <p>In 1977, Oksenberg took a two-year leave of absence from the University of Michigan to become a member of the National Security Council, where he was actively involved with the normalization of relations between the U.S. and PRC governments. He returned to the University in February 1980 and continued to advise the executive branch on matters of east Asian foreign policy until 1981.</p>
      <p>Oksenberg served as director of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies from 1989 to 1991. He left Michigan in January 1992 to become President of the East-West Center, a federally finances research and training institute in Honolulu, Hawaii. From 1995 until his death in 2001, Oksenberg was associated with the Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <p>The collection has been arranged into the following series: Academic and Professional Files; Publication Files; Course Materials; Student Files; University of Michigan Files; Research and Other Projects; Consulting; Topical Files; Photographs; and China - Special Files.</p>
    </arrangement>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>Michel Oksenberg papers document Oksenberg's activities as teacher, researcher, policy advisor, and business consultant, as well as his service on several national Chinese studies committees. The normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC) had a profound impact on American sinologists; Oksenberg's papers provide an overview of Chinese studies before, during and after normalization, while also furnishing insight into the actual process of normalization.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Academic and Professional Files series is the largest portion of the collection and offers the richest source of material from which to document Oksenberg's extensive and varied career. This series, consisting mainly of correspondence, but also including memoranda, reports, and other documentation, has been maintained by broad chronological subseries. Because of Oksenberg's many responsibilities and academic commitments and because these files came into the library in several different accessions, there is much overlapping between the several subseries. The researcher is therefore encouraged to examine the container listing carefully for related (though separated) files of interest to his/her research.</p>
          <p>Some of the subseries are arranged by name of individuals. Included in these are prominent sinologists such as A. Doak Barnett and John K. Fairbanks; policy makers W. Michael Blumenthal and Zbigniew Brzezinski; and presidents Nixon, Carter, and Bush. Other subseries are arranged by name of organization. Here the researcher will find Oksenberg's files from his activities with the Committee on Scholarly Communications with the PRC (CSCPRC); the Joint Committee on Contemporary China (JCCS); the National Committee on US-China Relations (NCUSCR); the Social Science Research Council (SSRC); and several other Chinese studies organizations. This series provides a sense of the changing concerns and priorities of American sinologists during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

          <p>The Research and Other Projects series includes files from a miscellanea of China-related activities. These include Oksenberg's interest in China and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), his study of the energy bureaucracy of China, and other U.S.-China r topics. The series contains transcripts and audiocassette tapes of interviews, correspondence, reports, journals and press clippings. Interview tapes and transcripts are of particular interest: there are transcripts of Oksenberg's extensive interviews with former US ambassador to the PRC Leonard Woodcock [box 35], and detailed interviews with Oksenberg about his role at the National Security Council [box 35]. This series also contains trip and interview journals from Oksenberg's many trips to China. Noteworthy are his notes from interviews with Chinese refugees conducted by Oksenberg in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

          <p>The China - Special Files are materials kept separate by Michel Oksenberg for their significance. Much of the material concerns trips (and preparations for trips) to China made by Oksenberg and other dignitaries mainly in the 1980s although some of documents date back to the Carter Administration. There are also several volumes and notepads of notes made by Oksenberg following conversations with individuals on subjects relating to U.S.-China relations.</p>
