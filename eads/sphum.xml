      <p>The School of Public Health at the University of Michigan officially dates from 1941, but the university had been a pioneer in public health education since 1887. In that year the State Board of Health suggested that the university establish a professorship of hygiene. The Board of Regents appointed professors Victor Vaughan, Albert Prescott, and John Langley to devise a plan for the creation of a Department of Hygiene. The committee recommended the establishment of a department of hygiene and physiologic chemistry. The head of the department was to have the title Professor of Hygiene and Physiologic Chemistry and Director of the Hygiene Laboratory. The Regents approved the committee's suggestion and named Vaughan to head the new department.</p>
      <p>The Hygienic Laboratory was established in 1889 and was the first laboratory of its kind in the country. It contained "all of the apparatus employed by Koch" and positioned the University of Michigan at the forefront of American bacteriological research. The laboratory was used for instruction in bacteriology, for research into the etiology of disease, and as a test site for food and drink suspected of contamination. The Regents' decision to finance the department was richly rewarded by the service provided and prestige garnered by the laboratory.</p>
      <p>The first degree in hygiene was awarded in 1897. From 1897 to 1916 the master's degree in public health was offered through the Medical School. In 1911 the Regent's established the degree of Master of Science in Public Health and approved the curriculum and degree of Doctor of Public Health that same year. In 1916 the public health program was transferred to the graduate school. An effort by the Regents to coordinate all health sciences work on campus led to the creation of the Division of Hygiene and Public Health in 1921. Professor John Sundwall headed this division until 1941. In addition to the public health program, the division at various times included the University Health Service, the physical education program, and a number of courses taught in other schools and departments. In 1934 Michigan became the first university to offer an organized program in the field of medical care.</p>
      <p>In 1939 the Board of Regents approved the creation of a School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine with the stipulation that "no addition to the budget of the Division of Hygiene and Public Health as adopted in 1939 would result from this action." The Rockefeller and W. K. Kellogg foundations provided grants of $500,000 each for operating expenses; this allowed the School of Public Health to begin offering classes in 1941-1942. Dr. Henry F. Vaughan, former Commissioner of Health in Detroit and the son of Victor Vaughan, was named the first dean of the School of Public Health in 1941. The grants also covered construction costs of the school's building on Observatory Road. The building was completed in 1943.</p>
      <p>The school was initially organized in three departments: Public Health Practice, Epidemiology, and Environmental Health. The Department of Public Health Practice included the fields of public health administration, public health economics, health education, health nursing, public health dentistry, physiological chemistry, mental health, and nutrition. The Department of Epidemiology encompassed public health laboratory practice, immunology, and health statistics. The Environmental Health Department covered public health engineering and industrial health. The departments within the School of Public Health were not static; they changed in response to dynamics within the school, the university, and the world of public health. Divisions developed into departments, then declined; totally new departments were created, then meiotically divided into newer programs and departments. Among those developing were Departments of Tropical Diseases, Biostatistics, Population Planning, Community Health, Hospital Administration, and Medical Care Organization.</p>
      <p>The school offered programs leading to master's and doctoral degrees in public health and to a bachelor's degree in public health nursing. In 1950, a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation permitted the creation of an undergraduate degree program in public health aimed at meeting the increasing demand for personnel to serve as administrators and technicians in government public health agencies. In addition, the school sponsored frequent institutes and inservice programs for health workers, administrators, and public officials. As in the nineteenth century, the School of Public Health proved responsive in fulfilling its service obligation to Michigan.</p>
      <p>From its inception, the School of Public Health has supported an active program of research. Thomas Francis, Jr., head of the Epidemiology Department, served as chairman of the Armed Forces Influenza Commission and directed the research at the school's Virus Laboratories that developed an influenza vaccine during World War II. Pearl Kendrick, a professor of epidemiology, did significant work in developing a vaccine effective against pertussis. Lowell Coggeshall, chairman of the Tropical Disease Department, conducted extensive studies on malaria control. The school is perhaps best known for its work on poliomyelitis. Under the direction of Francis, the school was the largest recipient of grant funds from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (later known as the March of Dimes). Francis conducted numerous epidemiological studies and Jonas Salk began the work which led to the development of a polio vaccine. The field test of Salk's vaccine was directed by Francis, in what was the largest mass experiment in medicine ever undertaken.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Public Health Economics, established in 1945 under the direction of Nathan Sinai, carried on extensive studies of voluntary health insurance plans, developed an evaluation schedule for the programs of the World Health Organization, and surveyed the public health services of numerous states and communities. Myron Wegman, dean of the School of Public Health, likewise manifested an interest in the economics of health care provision through his work on health maintenance organizations. The school has worked closely with state and local health agencies, most notably through the field experience portion of the curriculum and the Kellogg Foundation-sponsored Michigan Community Health Program. The school's work in the Tecumseh Community Health Study provides a Michigan analog to the ongoing Framingham study of health and disease patterns in a community over time. In the mid-1970s the school also undertook pioneering research into the short and long-range effects of PBBs (polybrominated biphenyls) on human health.</p>
      <p>Since 1941 the School of Public Health has graduated more than 7,000 professional health workers and ranks among the largest of the 24 accredited schools of public health in the United States and Puerto Rico. It is also one of no more than 100 such institutions world-wide. The School of Public Health has continued to emphasize epidemiology and population-based studies of health and illness through multi-disciplinary approaches to community-based health problems and health care delivery while adhering to the basic mission of contributing to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all people by disseminating knowledge, training health professionals and providing advisory and other services to agencies and individuals. Since the 1980s the school has focused on AIDS/HIV, substance abuse, smoking, air pollution, and health gerontology.</p>
      <p>Henry Vaughan served as dean of the School of Public Health from its institutional origin until his retirement in 1959. William C. Gibson was named acting dean and served a one-year term. Myron E. Wegman was appointed dean in 1960 and headed the school for fourteen years. Richard A. Remington succeeded Wegman in 1974 and served through 1982. John Kirscht was interim dean from 1982 to 1984. June E. Osborn took the reins in 1984, becoming the first woman to head the school. Richard E. Cornell served as interim dean from 1993 to 1995. In 1995 Noreen Clark, chair of the Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, was named as dean.</p>

          <p>The Histories/Bylaws series, 1942-1975, includes several articles on the history of public health education at the University of Michigan and a list of items placed in the cornerstone of the School of Public Health Building in 1944. This series also contains the bylaws dealing with the governance of the school and organizational charts detailing the changing departmental and divisional structure over time.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Files: Henry F. Vaughan, 1941-1967 (primarily 1941-1959), comprise the is divided into five subseries: Annual Reports, Committees, Correspondence, Faculty Correspondence, and Topical Files. Portions of the dean's files have been significantly rearranged in processing the collection. Among the least disturbed from the original order are the Annual Reports and Committees subseries. The annual reports, 1944-1959, are sometimes duplicates of those printed in the President's Annual Report, but they often include more detailed reports of departmental and faculty activities. The Committees subseries, 1941-1967, consists of individual files of minutes for various school and departmental committees. Most of these files are very incomplete; the collection has only limited runs of executive committee and faculty minutes, for example.</p>
          <p>The Correspondence, Faculty Correspondence, and Topical Files subseries represent a substantial rearrangement of the filing system used by the dean's office. In the original office organizing scheme all materials in these three subseries were in one alphabetical subseries filed geographically by origin or destination of the letter or memorandum. For example, correspondence relating to the planning and construction of the school's building was filed under "Battle Creek" because the architect was located there. Because this filing system hardly seemed intuitive for researchers, a new arrangement has been created breaking what had formerly been a single run of correspondence into three subseries: Correspondence, Faculty Correspondence, and Topical Files.</p>
          <p>The first two subseries can be seen as paired; one (Correspondence) dealing primarily with developments in public health outside the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and the other (Faculty Correspondence) dealing mostly with the internal workings of the school.</p>

            <p>The Correspondence subseries, comprising 1.6 linear feet of material, is arranged chronologically and covers the years from 1941 to 1959. This is the most diffuse subseries as it contains much information on developments in the field of public health, Vaughan's professional activities, and the school's work with international, national, state, and local health agencies.</p>

            <p>The Faculty Correspondence, 1941-1959, runs one linear foot and is arranged alphabetically by individual faculty member. This correspondence relates primarily to the governance of the school and to the activities of the faculty member or the department in which he or she served. For example, the H. E. Miller correspondence contains much material on the school's extension program and the many institutes and inservice courses the school sponsored. The Ella McNeil files include information on the public health nursing program.</p>

            <p>The Vaughan Topical Files, 1940-1959 subseries consists of correspondence, reports and other related material about a particular subject, program, or activity. The files are arranged alphabetically by topic and there-under chronologically. Among the significant topical files are Building Construction, which contains correspondence, drawings, and blueprints relating to the construction and expansion of the School of Public Health building; Division of Biological Sciences, consisting of early minutes of the Division; Hospital Administration Program; Institute of Industrial Health; W. K. Kellogg Foundation, concerning Vaughan's service on the Foundation Board and the Foundation's grants to the school; State Council of Health, which Vaughan chaired for a number of years; and the Tecumseh Community Health Study. The Course Outline files will be of particular interest to the researcher examining classroom content of public health education. The course descriptions, outlines, and lecture notes cover the years from 1943 to 1959 in an incomplete, yet informative way. The Topical Files also include newspaper clippings and photographs.</p>

          <p>Beginning in 1942, the School of Public Health sponsored a series of professional conferences whose records comprise the Institutes and Inservice Courses series. The materials in this series span the years from 1942 to 1957 and comprise 1.4 linear feet. The records relating to these institutes and conferences are mainly programs, planning documents, and proceedings. Many of these courses were special wartime training programs. The series is arranged chronologically with individual citations for those institutes or conferences which have published proceedings in the collection.</p>

          <p>The records of the Program in Public Health Nursing series span the years 1909-1977, but the bulk of the collection relates to the years 1941-1977 when the School of Public Health offered a graduate degree in public health nursing. This series consists of two linear feet of materials. Filed at the beginning of this series is a volume titled, "A Brief History of Public Health Nursing Education at the University of Michigan, 1919-1930," by Ruth Bishop, and one folder of miscellaneous historical notes and correspondence, 1909-1950. The rest of the records are arranged alphabetically by topic. Significant topics include: accreditation reports, 1956 and 1975; annual reports, 1961-1977; faculty minutes, 1941-1973; and reviews of the program, 1960 and 1968.</p>

          <p>Included within the School of Public Health collection are the records of the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH), 1941-2002. The ASPH is the professional organization and accrediting body for public health schools in the United States. The records of ASPH are arranged in several subseries based on the chronological span represented in various accessions which have been received by library.</p>

            <p>The 1941-1959 subseries is organized into University of Michigan Correspondence, 1941-1959; Minutes, 1941-1961; General Correspondence, 1946-1957; Legislation File, 1948-1959; Accreditation Reports, 1948-1949; and Accreditation Study, 1953. The University of Michigan Correspondence file belongs, in one sense, in Dean Vaughan's Topical Files. It consists of letters between Vaughan and the officers of the association. The rest of the ASPH material is more properly the archives of the organization which, for some reason, were deposited with the School of Public Health. The General Correspondence consists of letters between ASPH officers and the deans of other public health schools, government officials, and other health professionals. The Legislation Files include material on several Congressional bills designed to provide support for public health education. These files contain some interesting information on the relationship between the public health movement and the established medical profession as represented by the American Medical Association. The Accreditation Reports are summary reports on the programs of what were then the ten graduate schools of public health in the United States.</p>

              <p>The Association of Schools of Public Health, 1972-1983 subseries comprises two linear feet and continue the documentation of this professional organization and accrediting body of the United States Public Health Service (see also boxes 11 and 12). The ASPH material in the 1989 accession is not as University of Michigan-oriented but is retained with the collection due to Remington's active involvement in shaping ASPH policy. Of special note are the "Friday Letters" which weekly document the position of the ASPH on issues, legislation, and actions needed for the period from 1977 to 1984. The other files dealing with external issues is the PBB Study; these materials run 0.6 linear feet in Box 48 and document the school's efforts to establish via epidemiological and biological evidence the far reaching implications of polybrominated biphenyls on human health.</p>

            <p>The Association of Schools of Public Health materials comprise two linear feet and continue the documentation of this professional organization and accrediting body of the United States Public Health Service. The ASPH material in the 1989 accession is not as University of Michigan-oriented but is retained with the collection due to Remington's active involvement in shaping ASPH policy. Of special note are the "Friday Letters" which weekly document the position of the ASPH on issues, legislation, and actions needed for the period from 1977 to 1984.</p>

            <p>The Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH), 1984-1992 subseries, 2.6 linear feet, continues where the previous accession ended. The records document interaction with this organization which works to advance public health education, compile data on public health manpower, and serve as a liaison between public health schools, government agencies and other organizations. These functions are illustrated in the records which include annual meeting files, data reports, and correspondence with other deans and the ASPH executive director. The records also include the weekly "Friday Letters" briefs, 1985-1991.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Dean Myron E. Wegman (1958-1973) series comprises twelve linear feet in boxes 13-24 and consists of annual reports, correspondence, memoranda, minutes and reports, and photographs. These materials are arranged in annual files just as they were in the office of creation. Beyond conforming to this annual file scheme there has been considerable rearrangement during processing. Within annual files in the original order, materials were arranged alphabetically according to the geographic point of origin or destination of the correspondence. As this filing system seemed awkward at best, the materials have been rearranged in six subseries: Administration (School of Public Health), American Public Health Association (APHA), Committees, Correspondence, Departments/Divisions, and Programs.</p>
          <p>The materials dealing most immediately with the school's administration and teaching (Administration, Committees, Departments/Divisions, and Programs) have been disturbed least in the course of processing. These materials provide insight to how the school handled questions of power and change during years of growth in terms of physical size, breadth of research, and the number of students and faculty. Unlike the spotty coverage in the Vaughan years, the Committees run is quite complete, if circumspect. The Departments/Divisions describe the growing complexity of the School; the subseries can be viewed as an extension of the Faculty Correspondence subseries of the Dean Henry F. Vaughan series.</p>
          <p>The materials which do not immediately relate to the school (American Public Health Association (APHA) and Correspondence subseries) have been significantly rearranged during processing. The APHA materials have been removed from the larger run of correspondence (where they had been filed under "N" for New York and "D" for Washington, D.C.) and left to stand alone as a subseries. The ASPH materials reflect the growing professionalization of public health and the increasing importance of education in securing professional status. The Correspondence subseries has been completely rearranged within each annual file, moved from its original geographic order to a rough chronology based on month of creation. A final note on records in this group concerns conservation; evidently the school's storage area leaked, as many of the files were water damaged. The Bentley Library also holds Myron Wegman's personal papers.</p>

              <p>The subseries, Office Files; 1940-1978, comprises twelve linear feet and consists of diverse materials evidently used or stored as reference files. These records are arranged alphabetically by type of material and office of origin into four sub-subseries: Budgets, Committees, Core Course, and PBB Study. As with the Dean's files, these records pertain to both the internal workings of the School of Public Health (Budgets, Committees, and Core Course) and to the school's activities at the state (PBB Study) and national (Association of Schools of Public Health) levels</p>

              <p>The Budgets sub-subseries runs nearly 1.8 linear feet in Boxes 41 and 42 and provides detailed evidence of the financial operations of the school between 1940 and 1965. The relative importance of federal and foundation support is manifest in these records and the assessment of merit of individual faculty members is also revealed.</p>

              <p>The sub-subseries, Committees, 0.6 linear feet, contains the official set of Executive Committee minutes dating from the school's founding in 1941 through 1963. One notebook of Advisory Council Minutes (previously Development Committee), 1968-1978, is also included here. These minutes richly illustrate school-wide administrative issues and policy decisions. Scattered minutes and related material will also be found within the annual files in the dean's series.</p>

              <p>The Departmental Reviews sub-subseries consists of 2 linear feet of records dating from 1972 to 1987. The records reflect two major review cycles (1975-1976 and 1982-1983), when each department underwent review, and two lesser cycles when only select departments were reviewed (1985 and 1987). Documentation includes self-studies, reports of internal and external review committees, and occasional rebuttals to these reports. The reviews provide remarkable insight into the effectiveness of the school and the individual departments in meeting educational goals and objectives while also anticipating future trends.</p>

              <p>The Population Planning and International Health sub-subseries, 0.5 linear feet, contains records documenting the 1993 proposed moratorium on Population Planning and International Health faculty recruitment and student admissions. A special review committee convened to assess the situation and determined that the decision to enact the moratorium was arrived at outside the parameters of normal university protocol, and that the criteria cited for closure of the program did not align with the University's Standard Practice Guide. The committee recommended that the moratorium be lifted and the department not be closed. As a result, June Osborne announced her resignation as Dean effective September 1st, 1993, at which time Richard G. Cornell assumed his role as interim Dean of the School of Public Health.</p>

          <p>The Dean Richard Remington (1974-1981) series comprises the next twelve linear feet of the collection (Boxes 25-36). Like the materials in the Dean Myron E. Wegman series, these records are annual files arranged into six subseries: Administration, American Public Health Association, Committees, Correspondence, Departments, and Programs. The American Public Health Association files do not extend past 1974, reflecting the end of Remington's active involvement. The Programs subseries comes to be incorporated under the department rubric, under Community Health Services, as the school reorganized its administrative structure in 1978. This internal realignment reflects the school's efforts to present a comprehensive curriculum in the face of increasing diversification of specialties in the field of public health. Remington's Administration and Committees files are more detailed and more comprehensive than are Wegman's files. They provide an informative source on the perils of running a school during times of shrinking Federal and state funding for public health education. Especially illuminating are the accreditation reviews of 1975 and 1980, instances in which the school subjected its program to the rigors of peer review. As was the case with the Wegman materials, the Remington Correspondence was significantly altered from its original order based on geography to a month-by-month chronological sequence.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The materials of the Dean John P. Kirscht (1982-1983) series run two linear feet and consist of the 1982 and 1983 annual files. These are further arranged into four subseries: Administration, Committees, Correspondence, and Departments. The subseries dealing with internal affairs of the School (Administration, Committees, and Departments) are fairly complete and detailed. The Correspondence deals with external matters and has been put into chronological order by month during processing. The interim nature of Kirscht's position as Dean may be surmised from the thinness of his correspondence.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Dean June E. Osborn series (1984-1989, 9.0 linear feet), contains records from the first six years of Osborn's deanship as the first woman to head the School of Public Health. The 1984 annual files include material generated by Dean John Kirscht who served as interim dean until Osborn's appointment in July 1984. Like the series of the predecessor deans, the records are arranged as annual files, with repeated files within each year. The arrangement of the annual files has generally been retained as they were received. These records are noteworthy as they chronicle the rise of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and Dean Osborn's role as an expert on AIDS issues.</p>
          <p>The first three sub-subseries within each of the annual subseries pertain to internal matters within the School of Public Health: Administration, Committees, and Departments. The Administration sub-subseries contains material of broad interest to the entire school such as accreditation, affirmative action, continuing education, development and students. Some topical entries such as AIDS also appear in these files. The Committees sub-subseries contains minutes and related records from committees within the School of Public Health including the Executive Committee. Material in the Departments sub-subseries includes correspondence with faculty members, memoranda, and reports relating to administrative matters and staffing within the individual departments and programs.</p>
          <p>Unlike the earlier accessions, the geographic point of origin filing system for material generated outside the immediate confines of the School of Public Health has been retained in the annual files. This material has been divided into file headings that reflect the filing system as well as the hierarchy of the school's involvement with public health issues: International, National, State, and University. Due to unevenness in the records themselves, not all file headings appear in a given year.</p>
          <p>Although some intuition is needed to access these records, the folder listing contains sufficient detail to make these divisions meaningful. Within the State heading, for example, files are further broken down by cities. Thus, under Lansing will be found records pertaining to the Michigan Department of Public Health and the Governor's Task Force on AIDS. Files in the University sub-subseries reflect the School of Public Health's interaction with other University of Michigan schools, colleges, and administrative units.</p>

          <p>The Photographs series, 0.5 linear feet, includes positive prints and negatives documenting the administrators, faculty, and students of the school and some of their activities. The bulk of the material dates to the period between 1991 and 1996. The career and activities of David Striffler, pioneer in the field of dental public health, are represented strongly. A few records regarding Striffler's service to the public health community have been included in the folder containing his photographs in order to preserve the context of the record.</p>
