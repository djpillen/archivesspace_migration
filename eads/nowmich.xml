      <p>The National Organization for Women was founded in 1966. The Michigan Chapter (later Conference) of NOW was convened in December 1969 by Patricia Hill Burnett in Detroit. By the middle of 1971 local chapters had been established in Big Rapids and Lansing. The first annual state convention was held in June 1972. A year later, Michigan NOW could boast of 17 local chapters and more than 1000 members. By 1983, the state organization had grown to 28 chapters and 6500 members (a loss of 1000 members from its August 1982 peak).</p>
      <p>The formal structure of the state conference may be easily gleaned from the bylaws included in the collection. The bylaws of several local chapters (the structures of which usually closely resemble that of the state organization) are also represented. Briefly, the conference is directed by six elected officers, who form the Executive Committee. These executives are responsible to and form part of the State Coordinating Council (SCC), which meets three to five times a year. Ultimate power rests with the state membership, as represented at the annual state convention. The convention elects the state officers and sets broad policy agendas.</p>
      <p>The central focus of attention for Michigan NOW (as for every other state chapter) from 1972 to 1982 was the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The focus for Michigan NOW changed in the middle to late 80's as the state became involved in a heated and controversial battle over providing Medicaid funding for abortion. The Conference also played a key role in the battle for sex equity in Michigan public schools. The Conference has task forces on Lesbian Rights, Reproductive Rights, Economic Justice, Employment, Violence Against Women, and Homemakers' Rights, in addition to those on Education and the ERA, which give an indication of the organization's special concerns. In addition, local chapters are encouraged to mobilize for action on issues or events of local concern.</p>
      <p>Michigan NOW attempts to implement its priorities by working within the political process. The Michigan NOW PAC (Political Action Committee) permits the Conference to lend financial as well as volunteer assistance to candidates it has endorsed. Michigan NOW's Legislative Vice-President is charged with mobilizing the state membership in support of or in opposition to bills at the state and national level judged important to the goals of the organization (these include not only "women's legislation," but also a broad spectrum of civil rights, military, foreign policy, and economic bills). The Conference also employs a professional lobbyist at the statehouse.</p>
      <p>Some of the women who have been active as president in the Michigan Conference include (with dates of their presidency): Carol King, 1979; Barbara Miyata, 1980; Margot Duley Morrow, 1981-1983; Monica Smiley, 1983-1984; Barbara Hayes-Hamilton, 1984-1986; Marian McCracken, 1986-1988; Madeline Hansen, 1988-1990; Patty O'Donnell, 1990-1991; Lynn Hierholzer, 1991-1993; Gloria Woods, 1993-1995; Alicia Perez-Banuet, 1997-1998.</p>
      <p>Margot Duley-Morrow served as president of Michigan NOW for two terms, 1981-1983. Prior to that she was the state ERA Task Force Chair (1979-1981), and Ann Arbor-Washtenaw County chapter ERA Task Force Chair. She joined the Ann Arbor chapter in 1975. Professor Duley-Morrow taught Women's Studies courses at the University of Michigan from 1975 through 1984; she also directed the Pilot Program (1975-1979) at the University, among other duties. She left Michigan in 1984 to become director of Women's Studies at Ohio's Denison University.</p>

      <p>The Michigan NOW record group includes administrative records, files of individual presidents, newsletters from local chapters, records of the Michigan NOW PAC (Political Action Committee), and topical files of subjects of interests to the Michigan Conference such as the ERA, educational equity, and abortion rights.</p>
      <p>The organization of the collection is rather artificial, both because the documents were in extremely poor order upon their accession and because there is only the broadest unity to the collection's components. The records have been grouped under the name of the individual most responsible either for their creation or for their accumulation and preservation. There were two individuals primarily responsible for these records coming to the Bentley Library. They were Margot Duley-Morrow (two-term president, 1981-1983) who donated records in 1984 and Alicia Perez-Banuet (president, 1997-1998) who donated materials in three major accessions.</p>

          <p>The Margot Duley-Morrow accession (1973-1984; boxes 1-9) is comprised of fourteen series: Personal, Correspondence, Michigan NOW, Michigan NOW Coalitions, Clippings, Ephemera, Nan Frost Welmers files, Rhonda Drinan Files, ERA Task Force Chair, Shirley Monson files, Local Chapter files, Doris Little files, Virginia Harris files, and NOW newsletters.</p>

            <p>Of particular interest in the Personal series (1974-1983) is the folder entitled "Pedagogical Issues re: ERA." It contains an interesting exposition of Duley-Morrow's opinions about the legitimacy of the opposition to ERA and about the limits of the "equal time" doctrine in the college classroom. In the same series are three interns' reports on no-fault (divisible) divorce, funding of domestic violence programs in Washtenaw County, and independent practices for dental hygienists.</p>

            <p>Virtually all of the material in the Correspondence series (1979-1984) relates to Duley-Morrow's activities in Michigan NOW, first as ERA Task Force Chair and then as president. The topics of the correspondence run the gamut from requests for Duley-Morrow's participation in workshops and conferences to local chapter business, from policy discussions to more personal discussions of feminism. Duley-Morrow's correspondents include NOW officers at the local, state, regional, and national level, public officials, officers of other feminist, civil rights, and special-interest organizations, and representatives of the news media. Most of the correspondence are letters received, but some copies of letters sent are included as well. Included here as well are Duley-Morrow's notes of telephone conversations, which are quite legible, though at time cryptic. All in all, this series well-illustrates the varied duties and activities of a NOW state president, the broad affiliations of Michigan NOW in its pursuit of its goals, the personalities and relationships which vivify the organization: that is, both the formal and personal aspects of feminist activism are illuminated.</p>

            <p>The Michigan NOW series (1976-1984) includes a variety of records. The officers meeting minutes, the state conventions materials, and the State Coordinating Council (SCC) materials contain information regarding the establishment and implementation of policy. However, there is not as much substance in these folders as there could be. Convention and meeting agendas and minutes are very scattered (especially for the state conventions). However, the ephemera from the conventions is in itself informative, and includes proposed resolutions, and announcements of workshops and other events. In addition, the 1980 convention material includes Duley-Morrow's ERA Task Force report notes and notes regarding the balloting for state officers. The 1983 convention is most completely documented, and includes Duley-Morrow's script for directing the proceedings. Scattered through the convention and SCC material are annotations and notes made by Duley-Morrow. Also included in the SCC folders are scattered reports from other state officers.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the NOW PAC documents are meeting handouts and Duley-Morrow's notes. But there are, too, bylaws, scattered minutes, some candidate questionnaires and voting records, mailings, fund-raisers and notes on endorsements. In general, the documentation of Michigan NOW's political activities is disappointingly scattered. The Education Task Force files are, however, supplemented by the more extensive Education subseries of the Michigan NOW Coalitions series.</p>
            <p>The communications subseries is especially noteworthy for two folders: the speeches, etc. of Duley-Morrow and the Hotline. In the former is a ringing one and a half page undated summary of Michigan NOW's recent accomplishments and activities, set against the Conference's limited resources. The Hotline is a series of one-page mailings from the state president to chapter presidents, announcing upcoming events, calling attention to special issues and urging calls and letters to public officials or the news media, asking for short-term volunteer help, announcing changes in agendas or personnel, and the like. The Topical File subseries is composed largely of secondary material on the issues listed.</p>

          </did>
          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Michigan NOW Coalitions series highlights some of the social and political coalitions of which Michigan NOW is an important part. Of the five subseries, the first three--Education, ERA, and Women's Assembly III--are by far the most substantive and interesting. (Additional records relating to such coalitions will be found in the Michigan NOW, 1976-1979 subgroup and the Alicia Perez-Banuet subgroup).</p>
            <p>In the area of education, Michigan NOW made its most impressive contribution as a leader of the Michigan Project on Equal Education Rights (PEER). The Project's most significant effort was a suit filed against the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) to equalize funding and access for women in high school sports (c. 1979-1983). Memos, documents, and correspondence concerning the suit, and drafts of the formal complaint make up the most important portion of the Education subseries, though other PEER material--including documents pertaining to other PEER athletics lawsuits--are also included.</p>
            <p>The ERA subseries combines activities of Michigan NOW and those of coalitions including Michigan NOW; most often there was no clear dividing line. The Mailings to Michigan NOW Officers folder contains memos on strategy and updates on events from the "Conference ERA Task Force Chair. The Campaign Kits folder contains two examples of nuts and bolts instructions for activists in raising funds, recruiting volunteers, and coordinating events. The two most important groups of documents in the subseries are the Notebooks and the ERAmerica material. The notebooks are presumably those of the task force chair, and include a rich hodgepodge of sources: cartoons, clippings, position papers, flyers, activists' primers, ERA Alerts, and much more. The opponents of ERA are documented in the notebooks, too, as are rebuttals to the main arguments of those opponents. The notebooks represent Michigan NOW's ERA campaigning in microcosm. ERAmerica was the nationwide organization bringing together and coordinating the diverse groups dedicated to passing the amendment. The material here relates to the Michigan branch, and contains five years of newsletters announcing events, warning of trouble, and disseminating information. Other ERAmerica material is scattered throughout the subgroup.</p>
            <p>Women's Assembly III began in 1982 as a two-day convention of representatives of 28 women's groups in Michigan, meeting "to develop a feminist platform with the purpose of supporting and working toward the goals of power for all women and women in all places of power: (from the Assembly's "Preface"). The Assembly, in response to the success of the original convention, did not dissolve, but formed a permanent network to pursue its goals, and in 1983 became a co-sponsor of the International Women's Year (IWY) National Women's Conference. The Women's Assembly III subseries is dense with substantive material, outlining its principles and structure, documenting its platform, and illustrating its shift from two-day conference to permanent network. The Assembly is especially important because it represents a rather broad feminist consensus, and hence may serve to help define the parameters of the movement in Michigan.</p>

            <p>Regarding the Clippings series it should be noted that there are disappointingly few articles about Michigan NOW, though many on women's issues in Michigan and general Michigan politics. Many of the clippings concern the impact of the Reagan Administration's social policy on women. Most of the clippings are dated.</p>

            <p>The Ephemera series is composed of brochures, flyers, and miscellaneous mailings from Michigan organizations (or state branches of national organizations). This material illustrates both Michigan NOW's network of affiliations and concerns, and the activities of these diverse social justice, civil rights, and women's groups.</p>

            <p>The Chapter Information folder in the Nan Frost-Welmers series is a notebook containing forms for each local chapter which give information on the regularity of meetings, lists of officers, and other miscellaneous points. (Additional, and more substantive, information about local chapters will be found elsewhere in this collection). The State Newsletter folder includes meeting announcements, lists of officers, a report on "pro-choice" activities, a report on Michigan NOW's police, feminist song-lyrics, a 1977-1978 list of accomplishments, and miscellaneous material. Many of the documents in the Coalition series are flyers and mass-mailings, but the subseries also includes meeting agendas and not a little correspondence.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Rhonda Drinan files illustrate the state conference's role in energizing, disciplining, educating, and coordinating the local chapters of NOW, as well as the triumphs and traumas of the local chapters themselves. This series provides a fascinating glimpse into the institutional mechanics of the National Organization for Women.</p>
            <p>The Correspondence folder includes communications with the national chapter coordinator and requests from women seeking to join or organize a local chapter. Correspondence with the local chapters themselves --dealing with everything from confirming Drinan's appearance at a meeting to what to do about personality conflicts within a chapter--is contained in the Chapters subseries. The Notes and Materials subseries provides an overview of the duties, goals, and accomplishments of the Chapter Developer, as well as of the problems and priorities of leading a local chapter. It includes notes on the status and state of each chapter, and agendas and notes for Drinan's meetings with chapters. Specific material worth mentioning includes "Guidelines for Starting a NOW Chapter, "The Reaction of Women to the Inferior Status of Women," the notes on "feminist burn-out, and "How to Do an Auction."</p>
            <p>The cornerstone of the series is the Chapters subseries. Correspondence with chapter officers and material (flyers, agendas, handouts, handbooks) sent from the chapters to document their activities form the bulk of these files, though a good deal of routine bureaucratic communication is also present. The correspondence offers occasional glimpses into the personal conflicts and friendships which had so much to do with the success or failure of local chapters. Insights are afforded, too, into the sometimes tangled bureaucracy of NOW.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Michigan NOW Local Chapter Files (1969-1979) apparently have had an odd past. The documents dated 1969-1977 indicate that for these years the files were those of the Midwest Regional office of NOW. From late 1977 through 1979, the files seem to have been used by the Michigan NOW state president (Nan Frost-Welmers). Why the files were transferred is unclear, though it may have been part of the general reorganization when the Great Lakes Regional office was created or it may reflect a shift of the bureaucratic responsibility for convening local chapters. In any case, the files are a strange amalgam, especially since not every chapter folder contains documents from both periods. The quantity of material relating to the several chapters varies tremendously between them as well.</p>
            <p>However, the files are a gold mine, containing rich (if scattered) veins of fascinating records. Even the bureaucratic forms are interesting, in that they (along with some of the correspondence) provide an account of the lengthy and somewhat convoluted procedures for chartering a chapter, reporting elections, and the like, as well as of the efforts expended to generate interest in forming chapters. Other material includes announcements of chapter activities, chapter meeting agendas and minutes, questionnaires and surveys, chapter histories and bylaws, and more. Correspondence illustrating the Regional office's role in the NOW hierarchy is also present, as are communications between Frost-Welmers and local chapter leaders.</p>

            <p>Doris Little capped her long involvement with Macomb County NOW by serving as president of the chapter for the 1981-1982 terms. A retired professional whose other commitments included MENSA and Toastmasters, Little was known throughout Michigan NOW for her feminist activities, and helped to represent the Michigan Conference at the United Nations Women's Conference in Copenhagen (1980). The records in this subgroup mainly reflect the period during Little's presidency of the Macomb chapter. The division into Personal and Macomb County NOW series is somewhat artificial, as her personal life was quite intertwined with her identity as a NOW activist. Little died of cancer in December 1982.</p>

              <p>The Correspondence, Scrapbook, Speeches, and Engagement Books folders are the most substantive, and together comprise a portrait of a terrifically energetic, dedicated, and articulate woman. Her engagement books and calendars bear witness to the extraordinary range and number of her commitments. The Speeches folder includes a transcript of Little's testimony before a congressional budget impact hearing and a tape of an interview of her on a local radio program. The scrapbook includes clippings, correspondence, conference and meeting programs, flyers, and awards; it is something of a capsule history of the first half of her tenure as chapter president.</p>

              <p>Macomb County NOW subseries. The folder of board meeting minutes and the notebook, along with the scrapbook folders from the Personal series, solidly document the priorities, actions, and problems during one year of a local chapter's existence. The ad hoc committee material presents a more detailed look into one such priority and problem. With the corresponding newsletters (found elsewhere in this collection), Macomb County NOW becomes the best documented chapter in this collection.</p>

            <p>Detailed information about the month to month operations of Michigan NOW is available in the chapter newsletters, which announce Conference policy and statewide actions to the membership as well as communicate issues and events of local concern. Moreover, the local chapter newsletters in this collection cover a longer chronological period than do the newsletters of the state organization (although coverage varies from chapter to chapter). All in all, the local chapter newsletters might be the best place to start a study of Michigan NOW, since they provide easily accessible coverage of the accomplishments, personality, personnel, and evolution of the Conference.</p>

          <p>Alicia Perez-Banuet donated her presidential files and other organizational in two accessions, 2001 (boxes 11-14) and 2004 (boxes 15-19). The 2001 accession of approximately 4 linear feet donated by the 1997-1998 president of Michigan NOW do not necessarily represent the activity of Michigan NOW during Perez-Banuet's Presidency, but rather are a collection of general organizational files as well as files from various state officers collected throughout a two decade period leading up to Perez-Banuet's time in office. Subseries derived from this material include a Topical File, Correspondence, Chapter Newsletters, Macomb County NOW records, Administrative Files, and Officer Files. The most substantial portion of the files include extensive information on the battle to maintain state funding for abortions in Michigan and the activity of the NOW Political Action Committee (PAC) through each state and national campaign and election from 1982 to 1992. Scattered throughout the Officer and Administrative series are meeting minutes, leadership lists, agendas and other materials that give insight into the operating procedures of the Michigan NOW conference for a period spanning nearly 20 years.</p>
          <p>The 2004 accession of five linear feet, donated by Alicia Perez-Banuet, president for Michigan NOW, 1997-1998, broadly covers the period of 1976-1996. Some older records from the 1970s and early 1980s were a part of the accession. Overlaps with previous accessions were resolved by blending materials where appropriate. The records of this accession have been arranged in subseries that reflect functioning of the organization for the ease of the researcher. Because of the decentralized nature of Michigan NOW, there are gaps in the records. However, the permanent structures, such as the State Coordinating Council and its Executive Committee, serve as focal points for activities and tie the many chapters together. The bulk of the records are from the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>

            <p>Topical File (1972-1994; 2.3 linear ft.) includes information on many of the issues and activities the Michigan NOW conference has been involved with throughout the years. This accession expands upon many of the coalitions present in the Margot Duley-Morrow subseries. However, two topics (Abortion and ERA) and one committee (PAC) dominate the materials in this series. The material on abortion and the People's Campaign for Choice (PCC), the coalition formed by Michigan NOW to lobby for the retention of tax-payer funding for abortions, is very extensive and highlights the amount of work involved in that tumultuous battle. Included among the materials are a large amount of clippings from Michigan press, legislative information including House Bills and Senate Journals highlighting the activity in the state capitol, medical studies and reports, financial studies and reports on the cost of Medicaid abortions versus raising a child on Medicaid, and materials collected from the opposition Right-To-Life Initiative. The material on the ERA focuses mainly on attempts to lobby government in order to secure an extension to ratify the amendment. Because the ERA had already been ratified in Michigan, much of the material is based on the national effort and contains information about how the Michigan conference could work to support other states working towards ratification. In addition to the topics of abortion and the ERA, the Political Action Committee (PAC) material makes up a large portion of this series. The Candidate Questionnaires, no longer seen as a valuable source of information about a candidate, provide an interesting look into the ideologies of past political candidates from House Representatives to Governor. Along with these records are endorsement lists, election results, and other miscellaneous material that detail the importance of political elections to activist organizations such as NOW.</p>

            <p>Chapter Newsletters (1981-1989, 0.2 linear ft.) includes a heavy concentration of newsletters published between 1986 and 1989 from several of the local chapters active in the state. The continuity of the newsletters is very sporadic and incomplete, however, like the files of newsletters found in the first NOW (box 8-9) accession they provide pertinent information about NOW events and attitudes on the local, state, and nationwide level.</p>

            <p>Macomb County NOW (1977-1982, 0.2 linear ft.) includes press releases, meeting minutes, agendas, and correspondence relating to the activities of this local chapter. Much of the correspondence is directed towards, or written by, Doris Little, chapter president from 1981 to 1982. Material of interest includes a large folder containing the details of planning a "take back the night" (march against violence towards women) rally in Macomb County and a collection of photographs contained in the Chapter Activities (1981) folder that document an ERA rally at which Carol King was the speaker. King served as Macomb County NOW president, Michigan NOW president (1979-1980), and served as a National Board Member following her term as state conference president. This small collection of files compliments the Doris Little, Macomb County NOW subgroup from the first accession (box 7).</p>
