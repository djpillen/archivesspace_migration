      <abstract>The Lansing-based Michigan Environmental Council (MEC) formed in 1980 to coordinate lobbying and other member activities, distribute information, and monitor the environmental policies of state government. More recently, the council has focused almost exclusively on distributing information, directing funding, and building broad consensus on land use issues. The MEC records include information on significant environmental issues in Michigan as well as administrative papers pertaining to the council's operation.</abstract>

      <p>The Michigan Environmental Council (MEC) is a 501(3) organization that was created in 1980 at the urging of Ken Sikkema, director of the West Michigan Environmental Action Council. The original idea seems to have come out of discussions between Sikkema and Grant Trigger. In Sikkema's view, Michigan's environmental movement at that time was losing its effectiveness. After meeting many of its goals in the 1970s, economic problems in 1979 and 1980 had made it more difficult for existing environmental organizations to keep up lobbying activities. The West Michigan Environmental Council, East Michigan Environmental Council, Detroit Audubon Society, Flint Environmental Action Team, Michigan Audubon Society, and the Mackinac Chapter of the Sierra Club agreed to work together to build an effective coordinating organization based in Lansing. The six organizations created the council and hired Grant Trigger, an environmental engineer, as its first director.</p>
      <p>In 1983, Carol Dansereau, a lawyer, became director of the council. (David Dempsey had served for a time between Trigger and Dansereau.) Under Dansereau, the council changed its emphasis somewhat, emphasizing lobbying as well as providing information directly to individuals through the MEC newsletter (the <title render="italic">Michigan Environmental Report</title>), which began publication in January 1984. The council's total membership grew to 17 organizations by the time Dansereau left in 1986.</p>
      <p>David Stead then assumed the executive director position and continued the council's emphasis on lobbying during his tenure from 1987 until 1992. He was then succeeded by Carol Misseldine who in turn served until 1996. Under her guidance, the group continued to lobby on behalf of its member organization and provide timely information about environmental issues to members and its newsletter subscribers. In 1994, MEC launched the Land Stewardship Initiative and for the first time in its history, the organization devoted itself to a single (albeit broadly defined) goal. Thus, land use--and a host of related issues--became the focus of subsequent MEC activities and led to the hiring of Julie Stoneman in 1994 as its first Land Programs Director. By the time Misseldine stepped down in 1996, MEC had 21 full and associate member organizations.</p>
      <p>Lana Pollack, a former Michigan State Senator and founder of Michigan Monthly magazine, became president of the council in 1996 and served in that capacity through 2008. Her tenure witnessed MEC undergo vast changes in organizational structure and the expand its Land Stewardship Initiative to incorporate principles of Smart Growth, transportation design, and healthy community planning. During this period, full time MEC staff grew from five to twelve; the organizational budget increased from $320,000 to $2.3 million, and MEC came to represent 70 groups with a combined membership of approximately 200,000 Michigan citizens. In addition to lobbying, the council engaged in extensive coalition-building activities that resulted, among other things, in a ban on oil drilling below the Great Lakes and the passage in 1998 and 2002 of environmental bond issues. After a dozen years of leading MEC, Pollack was succeeded on January 1, 2009 by Chris Kolb.

      <p>The Michigan Environmental Council records depict the incremental growth of one of Michigan's pre-eminent environmental organizations. In addition to administrative records dealing with the council's operation, the record group also contain information on key environmental issues, major council initiatives, and MEC members. These records therefore will be of value to those interested in the environmental movement, Michigan legislative process, and the development of non-profit organizations.</p>

          <p>The Administrative Files series consists of two sub-series, 1980-1993 and 1993-1996 (both of which include earlier background materials), and each is further divided into "General Files" and "Issue Files." In both sub-series, the General Files deal with the administration of the council and include miscellaneous correspondence and papers relating to member and non-member organizations as well as government bodies. The 1993-1996 General Files also contains annual reports, recruiting practices, strategic planning, and material related to various MEC programs and wider initiatives (such as the Michigan Integrated Food and Farming Systems group and Urban Core Mayors coalition). Likewise, the Issue Files in each sub-series contain background information (clippings, state government documents, publications, etc.), correspondence, testimony, and other content relating to issues addressed by the council and, to a lesser extent, its individual members.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The President's Files series documents the main activities and professional interests of MEC's executive officer. This series begins with the records of Lana Pollack and includes files devoted to MEC's major concerns during her tenure, writings, speeches, and files from her term as a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Notable issues include environmental health, transportation, pollution prevention, clean energy development, and environmental toxins. Pollack's records also reflect MEC's interaction with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Quality, the administrations of John Engler and Jennifer Granholm, and various pieces of legislation as the council sought to improve the state government's stewardship of the environment. The involvement of MEC (and Pollack, personally) in a variety of programs is well-documented in files related to the Environmental Communications and Community Organizing (ECCO) Initiative, the Michigan Economic and Environmental Roundtable (MEER), the Michigan Action Program (MAP), the Southeast Michigan Consortium for Water Quality, and the Michigan Land Use Leadership Council (MLULC). In addition, Pollack's records contain the results from numerous polls and focus groups commissioned by MEC.</p>

          <p>The Associate Director's Files series contains materials related to the MEC administrator whose main responsibility is fund raising and grant management (a role subsequently filled by the Finance and Development Director). Patrick Diehl was MEC's first Associate Director and served in this capacity from 1996 to 2006. While his records deal with a variety of administrative functions, they consist mainly of information related to MEC grants and granting agencies (such as the Americans, Frey, and Mott Foundations) and related correspondence, reports, and budgets. This series also reflects Diehl's earlier work with Clean Water Action, his service on the board of the Environmental Fund for Michigan, and his work with the Michigan Great Printer's Project.</p>

          <p>The Policy Advisor's Files series includes a large body of information used by MEC to establish and support its position on a variety of environmental issues. David Dempsey served as MEC Interim Executive Director from 1982-1983 but left the council to serve Governor Jim Blanchard; he returned in 1994 and served as Senior Policy Advisor until his departure in 2004 (after which he worked as a consultant). Dempsey's files include background information and drafts for MEC publications and position papers dealing with such topics as Great Lakes pollution, environmentally friendly governance, environmental health, and pollution prevention. This series also contains material related to Dempsey's time with Clean Water Action, his personal work on Michigan's environmental history, and the organizational records of the west Michigan group Hope for the Dunes.</p>

          <p>The Land Programs Director's Files series is comprised of three sub-series (in addition to the general sub-series, Other) based upon the individuals who have held this position since its inception in 1994 until 2008: Julie Stoneman, Conan Smith, and Brad Garmon. The Land Programs Director is intimately involved in MEC's Land Stewardship Initiative and oversees the various aspects of the council's land use programs.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Julie Stoneman's files include her business correspondence from 1994 until her departure in 1998 as well as records related to her work on Michigan Drain Code Revision and Takings legislation. MEC's Land Stewardship Initiative (LSI) is particularly well documented in this sub-series, which includes biweekly updates of LSI activities from the <title render="italic">Michigan Environmental Reporter</title> newsletter. The series includes information on mini-grants awarded by MEC to other environmental groups as part of LSI as well as separate grants provided in conjunction with the Michigan Economic and Environmental Roundtable (MEER). Stoneman's records also document MEC's interaction with Michigan Integrated Food and Farming Systems and the One Michigan Initiative.</p>

          <p>The Publications series includes various publications produced for MEC members as well as the wider environmental and legislative communities. Biweekly reports to member organizations provide a thorough representation of MEC activities while the <title render="italic">Lansing Update</title> and <title render="italic">MEC Capital Update</title> document activities in the state legislative and executive branches. The series also contains a variety of other publications (such as several editions of the <title render="italic">Michigan Environmental Briefing Book</title>) and press releases, but does not include the <title render="italic">Michigan Environmental Report</title> (MEC's member newsletter), which is catalogued elsewhere in the Bentley Library.</p>
