      <abstract>Yale Kamisar, the Clarence Darrow Distinguished University Professor, was a professor in the University of Michigan Law School from 1965 to 2004. An expert in criminal law, particularly the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment and the Miranda right based on the Fifth Amendment, Kamisar was a proponent of defendant rights, and wrote extensively on the subject. In the 1960s, his arguments were influential as Chief Justice Earl Warren's Supreme Court ruled on several key defendants' rights issues, such as search and seizure (<emph render="italic">Mapp v. Ohio</emph>), guaranteed legal counsel to the poor (<emph render="italic">Gideon v. Wainwright</emph>), the right to counsel while in custody (<emph render="italic">Escobedo v. Illinois</emph>), and the right to remain silent (<emph render="italic">Miranda v. Arizona</emph>). Kamisar also wrote and lectured extensively on assisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy killing. His collection consists of research topical files; speech, debate, lecture, and presentation files; teaching files; and writings.</abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>Born August 29, 1929, in East Bronx, Yale Kamisar was the child of immigrant Jewish parents, Samuel and Mollie (Levine) Kamisar. Showing early promise in art, he attended the prestigious High School of Music and Art in New York City. Kamisar won an academic scholarship to New York University, graduating in 1950. He then attended Columbia Law School. Then the Korean War intervened. He enlisted in the army. Distinguishing himself as the commander of a platoon in the assault on T-Bone Hill, Kamisar earned a Purple Heart. He returned to law school in 1952, graduating with a L.L.B. in 1954.</p>
      <p>In 1955, Kamisar began his law career as an associate in the prestigious firm of Covington and Burling in Washington, D.C. There, he practiced anti-trust law. In 1956, in one of the few times he was in the courtroom, he represented (pro bono) a convicted drug user, who was appealing his conviction. Kamisar was appalled, when federal prosecutors attempted to use statements (which they believed to be incriminating) from the man's barely literate, hand-written petition, against his client. His impassioned statements in the courtroom won the client his appeal. This and other experiences however, convinced Kamisar that he was better-suited for the classroom.</p>
      <p>He began his teaching career, in 1957, as an associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. In 1959 he was promoted to full professor. He left Minnesota in 1964 to be a visiting professor at Harvard University Law School. In 1965 Kamisar came to Ann Arbor as a professor in the University of Michigan Law School. In 1979 he was named the Henry K. Ransom Professor, a title that he retained until 1992. That year Kamisar was named the Clarence Darrow Distinguished University Professor. While at Michigan, he taught courses in Constitutional Law, Criminal Justice, Criminal Law, and Evidence.</p>
      <p>Several decisions handed down by Justice Earl Warren's Supreme Court rendered criminal law a hot topic and with it, Yale Kamisar. These decisions included <emph render="italic">Mapp v. Ohio</emph> (1961), which prevented prosecutors from using evidence gathered in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure; <emph render="italic">Gideon v. Wainwright</emph> (1963), guaranteeing that states must provide legal counsel (at least in felony cases) to defendants who could not afford to hire their own; <emph render="italic">Escobedo v. Illinois</emph> (1964), which established the defendant's right to legal counsel while in custody; and <emph render="italic">Miranda v. Arizona</emph> (1966), requiring police to inform a defendant of his right, according to the Fifth Amendment, to remain silent. All these cases had been championed by Kamisar in his earlier writings. In 1965, he wrote an article entitled "Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure." Often quoted by <emph render="italic">Time</emph> and other popular publications, it was critical of the free hand that was wielded by police interrogators, asking why the constitution required so much in courtrooms (mansions), but meant so little in police stations (gatehouses). The justices cited this article, and other Kamisar work, in their opinions on the <emph render="italic">Gideon</emph> and <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> decisions. Kamisar also worked closely with the defending attorneys in the <emph render="italic">Gideon</emph>, <emph render="italic">Escobedo</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> cases.</p>
      <p>These cases were celebrated by civil libertarians but condemned by conservatives. Kamisar became a leader in the defense of the Warren court's rulings. While <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> and the exclusionary rule have been somewhat weakened by rulings of the Burger and Rehnquist Courts, Kamisar stands as an obstacle to their total reversal.</p>
      <p>Kamisar authored several prominent casebooks including <title render="italic">Constitutional Law: Cases, Comments, and Questions</title> with William B. Lockhart and Jesse H. Choper and <title render="italic">Modern Criminal Procedure: Cases and Commentaries</title> with Wayne R. LaFave and Jerold H. Israel. In 1958, Kamisar wrote an article entitled "Some Non-Religious Views Against Proposed 'Mercy-Killing' Legislation." This research interest was resumed in the mid-1970s, after the controversies surrounding Karen Ann Quinlan, Elizabeth Bouvia, and Sunny Von Bulow.</p>
      <p>Kamisar presented many lectures at leading law schools, including the Mitchell Lecture at the State University of New York in Buffalo in 1977 and the Marks Memorial Lecture at the University of Arizona Law School in 1990. In 1978 Kamisar received an L.L.D honorary degrees from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York, and an honorary degree from the University of Puget Sound in 1979. He was named Lee Distinguished Professor at the College of William and Mary for the 1987-1988 academic year. In 1990, he was cited by the <title render="italic">National Law Journal</title> as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in the country.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Kamisar began to plan for his retirement from the University of Michigan and accepted a position, as professor of law, at the University of San Diego Law School. He officially retired from the University of Michigan at the end of the fall term in 2003.</p>
      <p>Kamisar married Esther Englander on September 7, 1953. They had three sons, David, Gordon, and Jonathan. They divorced in 1973. Kamisar married Christine Keller in 1974. She died on June 12, 1997. Kamisar married Joan Russell, in February 1999.</p>

          <p>Research Topical Files series (14. 4 linear feet), covering the period from 1955 to 2004, documents Kamisar's standing in the legal and academic communities throughout the United States. The files were received in two accessions, but in fact represent a single run of files kept over his career.</p>
          <p>The Research Files include correspondence with Supreme Court justices, colleagues, judges, students, editors of law reviews, and publishers; articles by Kamisar and others, describing and arguing various cases and topics; Supreme Court and other judicial opinions and legal precedents; news clippings and op-ed pieces commenting on many aspects of legal opinion; and biographical information, including photographs. The original filing order was maintained. In most cases, Kamisar's secretarial staff used acronyms when filing, so the American Bar Association will be found under ABA and the Bureau of National Affairs will be found under BNA, though researchers should also consult the full name of the organization as well. His original folders were maintained, whenever possible, so that any notes Kamisar made on the folders are available for researchers. These include cross references which will aid in locating related material in the Research Topical Files series.</p>
          <p>Two principal areas of research interest for Kamisar are patient rights and defendant rights (Exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment and the <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> warning, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment). This series includes strong coverage of the protection of the rights of criminal defendants. The researcher will find multiple folders under the headings Confessions, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, Death Penalty, Drugs, and the Supreme Court. Early in his career, Kamisar became interested in patient rights as they pertain to criminal law, in such areas as assisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy-killing. There are multiple folders relating to these topics in this series, including Euthanasia (with folders discussing the cases of Baby Jane Doe, Paul Brophy, children, Medical Economics, and Karen Ann Quinlan's guardians) and Suicide (folders on assisted suicide and the Elizabeth Bouvia case). For more material on these subjects, researchers should consult folders in the Speeches Files, and Teaching Files under the heading "Criminal Law." In his Writings Files, researchers will find the 1958 article, published in the <title render="italic">University of Minnesota Law Review</title>, entitled "Some Non-Religious Views Against Proposed 'Mercy-Killing' Legislation" and another copy with a forward from 1973.</p>
          <p>Photographs of Kamisar can be found under Biography-Miscellaneous (Box 2) and Photographs (Box 12) and Vita (box 14),. There is also a photograph of Baltimore police chief Otto Urban (box 14).</p>

          <p>The Speech, Debate, Lecture, and Presentation series (1.3 linear feet), documenting the period from 1963 to 1994, is a partial file of the many speeches that Kamisar gave on capital punishment, constitutional freedoms such as the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and the <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> right to remain silent, criminal justice, the right-to-die, and various Supreme Court decisions. The speeches are arranged chronologically, with undated speeches filed first. The Law Week Conference presentations (1983-1994), sponsored by the Bureau of National Affairs, are filed together at the end of the Speeches series. These are usually commentaries on notable cases in the past year.</p>

          <p>The Teaching Files series (7.6 linear feet), covers 1959 to 2000 and includes assignments, cases, clippings, examinations and answers, notes, and occasional syllabi from Kamisar's classes in Constitutional Criminal Procedure (taught at Harvard University's Law School, 1964-1965), Constitutional Law (1971-1992), Criminal Justice (1977-1998), Criminal Law (taught at both the University of Minnesota and University of Michigan Law Schools, 1959-1997), and undated notes and cases for Criminal Proceedings.</p>
          <p>The largest subseries in the Teaching Files series is Criminal Law (6.7 linear feet). The Topical Teaching File is an alphabetical list of pertinent topics used in his teaching. These include Assisted Suicide, in particular folders on Jack Kevorkian and a 1993-1994 report from the Michigan Commission on Death and Dying; the Death Penalty, which contains the undated "Case of the Speluncian Explorers;" Euthanasia, with several folders on Jack Kevorkian and Karen Ann Quinlan, a 1997 transcript of the conference Socially-Assisted Dying: Media, Money &amp; Meaning; and Mercy-Killing Legislation. Researchers will also find multiple folders on Evidence, the Exclusionary Rule, Felony Murder, Insanity <emph render="italic">Miranda v. Arizona</emph>, Necessity, and the Race Riots of 1967 in Detroit and Newark, New Jersey.</p>
          <p>Also included in this series are two VHS videocassettes. The first is Kamisar's Criminal Law <emph render="italic">Miranda v. Arizona</emph> lecture. The second is his last Criminal Law lecture given at the University of Michigan Law School, in December 2003.</p>

          <p>The Writings series (.7 linear feet) includes drafts of articles written by Kamisar. This series is arranged chronologically by date of publication, with undated articles arranged alphabetically by title and located at the beginning of the series. Kamisar's 1958 work "Some Non-Religious Views Against Proposed 'Mercy-Killing' Legislation" is located in this series. In 1973, this article was reprinted, with a new forward, and retitled "Euthanasia: A Practical View." There are also several pieces on criminal law such as the 1967 <title render="italic">Supplement to Modern Criminal Procedure...and Basic Criminal Procedure</title> as well as several articles on the Exclusionary rule and <emph render="italic">Miranda</emph> rights. The series also includes studies on police interrogation, discussions of <emph render="italic">Gideon v. Wainwright</emph> on the decision's twenty-fifth anniversary, an analysis of the make-up of the Supreme Court, and two book reviews written by Kamisar.</p>
          <p>Drafts of writings and reprints are located throughout the Research Topical Files. In addition, researchers should consult the <title render="italic">Michigan Law Review</title> for Kamisar articles published there. Volume 99, issue 5 of the <title render="italic">Michigan Law Review</title> is dedicated to Kamisar. For more comprehensive bibliographies of Kamisar publications, researchers should consult the folder title "Bibliography" and "Publications" under the heading "Biography" located in box 2.</p>
