      <p>James ("Jimmy") Bennett Griffin was one of the major forces in the development of North American archaeology. In his long, productive, and highly distinguished career spanning nearly seven decades, he played a pivotal role in transforming American archaeology into a fully scientific discipline.</p>
      <p>James B. Griffin was born in Atchison, Kansas on January 12, 1905. His father's occupation as a railroad man moved his family from Kansas to Denver to Oak Park, Illinois during Griffin's childhood. Griffin entered the University of Chicago in 1923 for undergraduate study. He initially pursued a course in business administration, then law, but eventually settled on a social science major. His studies exposed him to introductory anthropology and ethnology courses, including one taught by Fay-Cooper Cole, and engendered a lifelong fascination with human origins and cultural development.</p>
      <p>Griffin received his bachelor's degree from Chicago in 1927, but with his father ill and his family in need of financial support, he decided to enter a training program to become a junior executive for Standard Oil of Indiana. He manned service stations in the Chicago area for about a year and a half, but quickly lost interest in a career in business. In 1928, Griffin abandoned business permanently and returned to the University of Chicago to pursue a master's degree in anthropology under Cole. While in the master's program, Griffin took courses and participated in his first archaeological fieldwork through excavations at various sites in Illinois, deciding that archaeology rather than other areas of anthropology was his particular area of interest and would serve as the basis for his further study.</p>
      <p>Griffin received his master's degree in 1930, then was hired in the summer of 1931 to direct excavations at Athens, Pennsylvania for the Tioga Point Museum under a grant from the National Research Council. He planned to return to Pennsylvania the following year to excavate near Wilkes-Barre, but funding for the project was canceled. In late 1932, Cole put Griffin forward for a fellowship in Aboriginal North American Ceramics administered by the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Michigan with financial support from philanthropist Eli Lilly. The museum's director, Carl Guthe, selected Griffin for the fellowship and he began his pursuit of a doctoral degree in anthropology at Michigan in 1933. Griffin would spend the next fifty years at the university in one role or another.</p>
      <p>Griffin's fellowship and work with the Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States formed the basis for his Ph.D. thesis (completed in 1936) and many of his early publications. The most significant of these was <title render="italic">The Fort Ancient Aspect</title>, published by the University of Michigan Press in 1943. Griffin also served as the editor for the important survey publication, <title render="italic">Archaeology of Eastern United States</title> (University of Chicago Press, 1952), a festschrift for his mentor, Fay-Cooper Cole.</p>
      <p>Griffin worked his way up through the ranks of the Museum of Anthropology, progressing from Research Associate to Assistant Curator to Associate Curator to Curator from 1936 to 1945. In late 1943 Carl Guthe resigned as director of the museum and recommended that Griffin be appointed as his successor. Administrative conflicts stalled the appointment for several years, but he was finally approved by the Regents as the museum's director in 1946. Griffin held this position until his retirement in 1975.</p>
      <p>In addition to his work at the museum, Griffin was also very active in the university's Department of Anthropology. He was named Associate Professor in 1945 and promoted to Professor in 1949. He chaired the dissertation committees for more than 40 doctoral students and was an active teacher and advisor. He also served as the department's chair from 1972 to 1975.</p>
      <p>Griffin participated in many important initiatives outside the University of Michigan. From 1940 to 1946 (with a break during the war years), Griffin, along with James Ford of Louisiana State and Philip Phillips of Harvard, organized and led the Lower Mississippi Valley Survey. The survey marked one of the first instances of significant inter-institutional cooperation in North American archaeology. Griffin continued his work in the area with the Central Mississippi Valley Archaeological Survey (C.M.V.A.S.), the Cahokia excavations, and the FAI-270 Archaeological Mitigation project.</p>
      <p>Griffin was not primarily a field archaeologist, however. His passion and expertise lay in making connections and surmising relationships between different artifacts, geographic areas, sites, and cultures. He was known for his piercing intellect, encyclopedic memory and vast knowledge of the prehistory of North America, externalized in his extensive index cards and pictorial files of ceramics and artifacts. He visited sites throughout the country to collect information and was widely consulted by professional and amateur archaeologists on an array of topics. Throughout his career, Griffin published his own work prolifically, and often reviewed the work of others.</p>
      <p>While his primary interest lay in the archaeology of North America, Griffin had many other interests. He traveled extensively, including a year-long study tour of Western Europe from 1953 to 1954 and a research trip to Soviet Russia in 1961, and was involved in initiating some of the earliest field projects for American graduate students behind the "Iron Curtain" in Poland and the former Yugoslavia. Griffin also participated in many regional, national, and international professional organizations, including terms on the leadership boards of the Society for American Archaeology (SAA), the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS), the American Anthropological Association (AAA), and the Council on Michigan Archaeology (COMA), among others.</p>
      <p>Griffin was a pioneer in the development and use of several tools for the scientific analysis of archaeological specimens. Along with H.R. Crane of the university's Department of Physics, Griffin founded and provided oversight for the Radiocarbon Laboratory, in operation at Michigan from 1949 to 1970. The Radiocarbon Laboratory and its program of C-14 dating of specimens was the second of its kind in the United States. In the 1960s, Griffin collaborated with Michigan chemist Adon Gordus in the use of neutron activation analysis for sourcing obsidian, one of the most important analytical tools available to archaeologists for the study of prehistoric exchange. Griffin was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1968 for his innovative scientific work.</p>
      <p>After Griffin retired in 1975, he spent a number of years in Ann Arbor as a Research Scientist of the Museum of Anthropology. He then moved to Washington, D.C. in 1984 to serve as a Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institution. He continued to be active in the field of archaeology almost to the very end of his life, attending professional conferences, contributing to publications, and serving as an official or unofficial advisor to scores of younger archaeologists.</p>
      <p>Griffin married Ruby Fletcher on February 14, 1936. They were married for over forty years, until her death in 1979. Together they had three sons, John, David, and James. Griffin met his second wife, Mary Marsh DeWitt, while living in Washington. They were together for twelve years, until his death on May 31, 1997, at age 92.</p>
      <p>(In addition to the wealth of biographical information that can be found in these papers, there are a number of published biographical resources for James B. Griffin. These include memorials and obituaries published after his death (including "James Bennett Griffin, 1905-97" by Richard I. Ford, published in <title render="italic">American Anthropologist</title> in 2002), his entries in reference publications such as <title render="italic">Who's Who</title> and the <title render="italic">International Directory of Anthropologists</title>, and Griffin's autobiographical essay "An Individual's Participation in American Archaeology, 1928-1985," published in the <title render="italic">Annual Review of Anthropology</title> in 1985.)</p>

          <p>The Student Years series, 1922-1936 (1 linear foot), consists primarily of course notes, papers, examinations, and project background research from Griffin's time as a graduate student in the master's degree program in anthropology at the University of Chicago. The series also includes a small amount of material related to Griffin's high school studies, undergraduate degree (also received from the University of Chicago) and doctoral program (at U-M), as well as one folder of correspondence. The folders titled "Anthropology at American Universities" and "History of Anthropology" contain research Griffin conducted while he was a student on the early development of the field, and include letters from representatives of anthropology departments around the United States.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>The Correspondence, 1930-1975 series (25 linear feet) contains Griffin's incoming and outgoing personal and professional correspondence during the most active years of his professional career. The series is incredibly rich as Griffin corresponded with nearly all of the prominent figures in North American archaeology of his time. The series includes not only letters, postcards, and telegrams, but also drafts of articles, reports from field sites, maps, and photographs of people and objects (more comprehensive documentation on particular archaeological sites, photographs, and extensive publication files can be elsewhere in the papers). The series is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, with any supplemental material from a particular correspondent filed together with his or her letters. While most of the correspondence, including all with regular correspondents, is arranged in individual folders by the name of the correspondent, correspondence with infrequent correspondents and some routine correspondence is collected alphabetically in the "Miscellaneous" folders at the end of each letter range.</p>
          <p>The series represents all phases of Griffin's pre-retirement professional career. Early correspondence includes letters to and from Griffin's mentors, most notably Fay-Cooper Cole and Carl Guthe. Later correspondence shows Griffin as a mentor and advisor himself, to students and junior colleagues including Gregory Perino, Stephen Williams, Jeffrey Parsons, Wesley Hurt, Clifford Evans, Betty Meggers, and Dan Morse. Correspondence with Griffin's contemporaries figures prominently throughout the series, and provides insight into his long-term associations with Irving Rouse, J.O. Brew, Emil Haury, Gordon Willey, Charles Fairbanks, Philip Phillips, Richard MacNeish, Jesse Jennings, and Fred Eggan, among many others. Griffin's correspondents spanned all of North America, and included Mexican archaeologists such as Eduardo Noguera, Pedro Armillas, and Ignacio Marquina, and Canadians such as William E. Taylor and J. Norman Emerson.</p>
          <p>Correspondence with Griffin's University of Michigan colleagues, including museum curators and administrators Carl Guthe, Albert Spaulding, Kamer Aga-Oglu, Richard Ford, and Volney Jones, and Department of Anthropology heads Leslie White and J.N. Spuhler, is well represented in the series. The Museum's evolving status at the University of Michigan can be seen in discussions with university administrators such as College of Literature, Science and the Arts (LS&amp;A) deans Alfred Sussman, Ralph Sawyer, and William Haber, and executive officers such as Secretary of the University Herbert Watkins and Assistant to the President Erich Walter. Correspondence from Griffin to his secretary at the museum during his leave year in London from 1953-1954 and during a summer project in 1952 provides insight into his activities while away from the museum, as other museum curators' correspondence to him from the field provides insight into theirs.</p>
          <p>Griffin's correspondence documents not only individual personalities and research in North American archaeology, but also broader themes in the field. Griffin's extensive correspondence with his early patron Eli Lilly, and proposals to major sources of funding for anthropology, including the Wenner-Gren Foundation (as found particularly in the correspondence with Paul Fejos) and the National Science Foundation, demonstrate the crucial role outside financial support played in the development of the archaeological field. While Griffin corresponded regularly with a number of amateur archaeologists and received volumes of inquiries from avocationalists throughout his career, like many of his academic peers, he was also very concerned with the professionalization of archaeology. Griffin was one of the original 31 signers of the constitution of the Society for American Archaeology and served as an officer from 1945 to 1956 (including a term as president in 1951), and his correspondence with fellow officers and members demonstrates the growth of this important professional association.</p>
          <p>While most notable for its documentation of the field of North American archaeology, the Correspondence, 1930-1975 series also contains materials that illustrate and provide insight into key events and trends in American history. Correspondence from the 1930s includes letters from a number of people working for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a key source of funding for North American archaeology in its formative years. Parallels with the early Cold War crusades of the House Un-American Activities Committee can be seen in the case of James Griffin's friend, Richard G. Morgan, who was fired from the Ohio State Museum (and effectively exiled from the academic field of anthropology) in 1948 for his purported ties to the Communist Party. Correspondence from this time period between Griffin and Morgan, as well as with John W. Bennett and Fay-Cooper Cole, provides insight into the specifics of the case and the American Anthropological Association's (AAA) intervention on Morgan's behalf.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence, 1975-1997 series (6 linear feet) contains incoming and some outgoing personal and professional correspondence from the years following Griffin's official retirement from the Museum of Anthropology. The series employs the same alphabetical arrangement as the Correspondence, 1930-1975 series, but is maintained separately because of the differing nature of its content and context of creation. There is significant overlap between the correspondents in both correspondence series; in most cases, the researcher interested in seeing a comprehensive record of correspondence with a particular person should consult both series.</p>
          <p>Despite being officially retired, Griffin remained active in the Museum of Anthropology for a number of years, and, particularly in his correspondence with museum administrators Richard Ford, Henry Wright and John Speth, the series reflects his continuing participation in its promotion and development. Much of his focus turned to pursuits outside the University of Michigan, however. For a great deal of this later period, Griffin held a resident research associate position at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. Much of the correspondence in this series concerns publications he wrote, edited or for which he provided editorial advice, conferences and meetings in which he participated, advising to dissertation writers, and consulting he provided either on his own or as a representative of the Smithsonian. The correspondence also serves as a testament to Griffin's many continuing professional friendships, with substantial accumulations of letters from Stephen Williams, Dan Morse, Anna Roosevelt, Penelope Drooker, N'omi Greber, and a number of others.</p>

          <p>The Radiocarbon Laboratory series, 1949-1972 (15 linear feet), documents the activities of the Radiocarbon Laboratory, in operation at the University of Michigan from 1949 to 1970 as Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project #6. The series is held in five subseries: Correspondence, Datasheet Notebooks, Lab Administration, Research, and Card Files. (Additional information on the laboratory and related research projects can be found in the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project record group, also available at the Bentley Historical Library.)</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Correspondence subseries consists mainly of correspondence between the lab's administrators and research assistants and those who sent specimens to be analyzed. The subseries is divided into two chronological spans, 1949-1960 and 1961-1971, with the correspondence within each sorted alphabetically by the name of the correspondent. While the correspondence in this series is almost exclusively focused on the activities of the lab and the dating of specimens, there is some material on other subjects and a great deal of overlap between the correspondents in this subseries and those in the larger Correspondence, 1930-1975 series. A substantial portion of the correspondence in this subseries was not written by Griffin; other writers include lab administrators H.R. Crane and Volney Jones, and research assistants Alan McPherron, Ingrid Christensen, Arthur Jelinek, David M. Griffin (Griffin's son), Roscoe Wilmeth, and Jeffrey Parsons.</p>

            <p>The Datasheets Notebooks subseries contains the contents of three-ring notebooks that held individual datasheets of information on samples submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory. From 1956 until the lab's closure, a listing of dated specimens was submitted to and published periodically in the journal <title render="italic">Radiocarbon</title>. Each listing was referred to as "Michigan" followed by a sequential Roman numeral. This subseries contains the datasheets for nearly all of these published listings, though datasheets for samples published in listings before Michigan XI were not filed together. Often, however, the earlier datasheets have a handwritten Roman numeral on them indicating in which listing they appeared. Datasheets for samples that were never published can be found in the folders labeled "Datasheets Impossible to Publish."</p>

            <p>The Research subseries contains information on an ongoing research project that, while separate from the Radiocarbon Laboratory, drew on some of the same personnel and expertise. Funded from 1956 to 1965 as Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project #132 under the working title "Study of Radioactivity Levels in Prehistoric Materials," this project sought to obtain equipment and develop methods for measuring radioactivity in specimens to apply to the problems of dating and identification. Over the years, the project was directed by F.P. Thieme (1956-1958), James Griffin (1958-1961), and Arthur Jelinek (1961-1965), and employed several research assistants, including Jelinek (1957-1958), Lewis Binford (1958-1960), James Fitting (1961-1963), and Charles Cleland (1962). At its culmination, a series of reports of the project's findings were published as University of Michigan <title render="italic">Anthropological Papers</title> No. 25. The subseries contains proposals, correspondence, research reports, datasheets, and administrative materials related to the project, as well as a draft of a Binford manuscript not included in the <title render="italic">Anthropological Papers</title> volume.</p>

          <p>The Professional Associations and Affiliations series, 1939-1992 (2 linear feet), contains correspondence, reports, and other information related to Griffin's participation in various professional organizations and honor societies. This series differs from the Professional Organizations and Recurring Conferences subseries of the Conferences and Symposia series in that it relates mainly to non-conference activities. The bulk of the series consists of material related to the Conference on Michigan Archaeology (COMA -- also known as the Council on Michigan Archaeology), for which Griffin served as chairman from 1966 to 1976, and to the Anthropology section of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), for which Griffin served as chair from 1975 to 1978. Information is also included on Griffin's participation in several Society for American Archaeology initiatives, including the Committee on Archaeological Terminology.</p>

          <p>The Speaking Engagements series, 1944-1989 (1 linear foot), contains organizational information, background research, and writing for speeches, lectures and talks Griffin gave outside of professional conferences and symposia. These include lectures on college campuses, speeches at dedications and special events, and talks given as part of Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) lecture tours. Again, in some cases there may be overlap between this series and the Writings and Publications series. The series is arranged chronologically by date, with a small amount of miscellaneous material filed at the end.</p>

          <p>The Travel and International Initiatives series, 1946-1973 (1 linear foot), contains correspondence, planning materials, proposals and reports related to international travel and archaeological exchange programs in which Griffin was involved. These include a six-month stint in Mexico in 1946, a year-long European study tour from 1953 to 1954, study in the former Soviet Union in 1962, and University of Michigan cooperative agreements for archaeological digs in Poland, the former Yugoslavia, and Israel. (Please note that most of the general correspondence Griffin sent or received while traveling is filed in the Correspondence, 1930-1975 series. In particular, Griffin's correspondence to and from the Museum of Anthropology during his European study tour is filed under "Griffin, James B.")</p>

Most of the works in this subseries were eventually published, though virtually all of the material included here is in its pre-publication form. Of particular note are drafts and background research for Griffin's M.A. and Ph.D. theses and his first book <title render="italic">The Fort Ancient Aspect</title>, reports from Griffin's work with the Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States, and supplementary material for biographical essays on various archaeologists, including Carl Guthe. Book reviews, information related to Academic Press' New World Archaeological Record monograph series, for which Griffin served as editor, and a small amount of miscellaneous material are included at the end of the subseries.</p>

            <p>The By Others subseries is arranged alphabetically by the author's name. The subseries contains unpublished reports, conference papers, and drafts (which may or may not have later been published); published articles, reprints and published site reports sent to Griffin as a courtesy have been removed. Some individual titles are listed, but when an author's name is followed by a folder titled "Papers," this indicates that the folder contains multiple writings that were filed collectively by Griffin under the author's name rather than by title. Griffin served as a formal or informal advisor to the authors of many of the works in this subseries. Some works include Griffin's comments and criticisms.</p>

          <p>The Hopewell series, 1938-1992 (1.25 linear feet), contains research files on Hopewell culture, a network of beliefs and practices among different Native American groups over much of eastern North America and one of Griffin's major areas of interest. Many of these files seem to have been compiled as research for a book-length manuscript on the Ohio Hopewell that Griffin, along with N'omi Greber, worked on for a number years, but apparently never completed. While this series represents a significant accumulation of Griffin's research on Hopewell, other writings, research files, and correspondence about this topic are located throughout the papers.</p>

          <p>While the majority of information on Griffin's research and activities can be found in other series within these papers, the Topical Files series, 1929-1991 (5.5 linear feet), contains correspondence, reports, reviews, and research files related to select topics, and is divided into seven subseries: Archaeological Subject Files, Ceramics Research, Consulting, Grant Proposals and Projects, Neutron Activation Analysis, Program Reviews and Evaluations, and University of Michigan.</p>

            <p>The Archaeological Subject Files and Ceramics Research subseries contain research on a number of different topics in archaeology. Most of these files do not relate to a single archaeological site or project, but rather a geographic area, chronological period, culture, or topic. Of particular note within the Ceramics Research subseries are notes Griffin compiled while researching pottery in the former Soviet Union in 1961.</p>

          <p>The Archaeological Sites and Projects series, 1931-1992 (6 linear feet), contains field notes, reports, photographs, maps, proposals, and correspondence related to individual sites and large-scale multi-year projects in North America. Griffin participated in some of these personally, provided consulting on others, and received reports for many to assist in his own research. Most of the files in this series are grouped by state or province, then alphabetically by site name. Projects that cover multiple areas are filed by project name. Significant accumulations include those for the Central Mississippi Valley Archaeological Survey (C.M.V.A.S.), the Lower Mississippi Survey, Cahokia, and the Illinois-based FAI-270 project, as well as for sites in the state of Michigan. The researcher should note that material on archaeological sites and projects can also be found elsewhere in the papers, particularly in the two Correspondence series, the Writings and Publications series, and the North American Archaeology Card Files.</p>

          <p>The North American Archaeology Card Files series, ca. 1930s-1990s (122 linear feet), is the largest series in the papers, and consists of Griffin's extensive index card and photograph files on archaeological sites, surveys, artifacts, and cultures. The bulk of the material was compiled from the 1930s to 1970s, though some material from before and after this date span is also included. Griffin's filing system has been kept virtually intact; the categories and organizational schemes are the ones he used in his research. The series includes the card files amassed in Griffin's work with the Ceramic Repository of the Eastern United States, as well as field notes, survey cards, and research compiled by Griffin and others, with particular emphasis on the midwestern and southeastern United States. Although North America provides far and away the bulk of the series, a small amount of material related to geographic areas beyond North America, including Europe and South America, is also included.</p>
          <p>Much of the material on archaeological sites in this series was not collected by Griffin firsthand; rather archaeologists sent documentation from their sites for Griffin to analyze. The cards are rich in information, including information about what, where, when, how, and by whom materials were collected. In addition to thousands of images of sites and artifacts, photographs of Griffin and other archaeologists are sometimes filed within the organizational scheme. With the exception of the large mounted photographs, most of the cards measure 5" x 8". The series includes four subseries: Geographic Areas and Cultures, Miscellaneous, Large Mounted Photographs, and Mississippi Valley Aerial Photos.</p>

            <p>The Geographic Areas and Cultures subseries is far and away the largest of these subseries, and the bulk of it is arranged geographically, mainly by state or region, though within a particular geographic division there may be additional subdivisions by site or culture. Files for several large surveys are included in this subseries, including the Central Mississippi Valley Archaeological Survey, which stretched from Illinois to Arkansas, and the River Basin survey, part of the Inter-Agency Archeological Salvage Program.</p>

            <p>The Mississippi Valley Aerial Photos subseries contains prints of index maps and photographs of the Mississippi Valley taken by the United States War Department. (Presumably Griffin used these as reference tools for his work in the Mississippi Valley.) The prints are arranged by quadrangle and flight.</p>

          <p>While photographs can be found throughout the papers (particularly in the North American Archaeology Card Files series), the Photographs series, ca. 1920s-1990s (0.25 linear feet) contains an accumulation of Griffin's more personal professional photographs. Prominent subjects includes Griffin portraits, Griffin and other archaeologists at various sites and conferences, Museum of Anthropology staff members, and the Radiocarbon Laboratory. In some instances correspondence providing context for particular photographs has been included.</p>
