          <p>The Projects/Collaborations series documents University Library projects and collaborations with other University of Michigan units and organizations. This includes collaboration with the Alumni Association to develop their new educational emphasis; the "Computers in Composition" collaboration with LS&amp;A to analyze how computers might change writing and thinking, the Gateway Project, which created the first institutional home page for the university; the creation of living/learning centers and residential communities; and collaboration between the Library and Information Technology Division to form the Microcomputer Center on campus. Also documented in this series is the collaboration between the Library and Housing to form the residence hall library system, which was ultimately discontinued; the UM Instructional Environment (originally Digital Classroom), a Library-led collaboration that became the blueprint for the original Coursetools, subsequently CTools; early use in the Library of UMTV, the original campus cable network; and Virtual University, originally a collaboration between Michigan colleges and universities and industry to provide online education to workers, but later focusing more on providing online courses to K-12 students.</p>

          <p>The Undergraduate Library series is the largest in the collection. It contains extensive material on the Library's early years, Peer Information Counseling Program, Shapiro Building Project, Sight and Sound Center, student assistants handbooks, and 30th Anniversary. Files on the early years of the Undergraduate Library include personnel records, photos, and purchases. Peer Information Counseling Program files document the history of the nationally recognized Library program supporting the needs of a diverse student community. The Shapiro Building Project files include plans, proposals, and schedules for the transformation of the Undergraduate Library in the early 1990s. The Sight and Sound Center files document the transition and ultimate closing of the original media center in the Library as media formats evolved. The student assistants handbooks were designed to support and develop the skills and understanding of student assistants, an important part of the Library's staffing model. The 30th Anniversary files include photos, flyers, programs, and display items for the 30th Anniversary of the Undergraduate Library in 1988. Other folders within the series include material on topics such as the Branstrom Prize, collection development policy, Debate Institute, and UGLI newsletters.</p>
