      <abstract>The office of the Vice Provost for Academic and Multicultural Affairs was originally established to develop and support programs to aid the University of Michigan in the recruitment and retention of students, faculty, and staff of color. The scope of the duties of the office were later expanded to include administrative oversight of a number of programs and services for faculty and students. The bulk of the record group is comprised of topical files related to multicultural issues, correspondence and reports relating to particular initiatives and funding programs, and administrative office files.</abstract>

      <p>In June 1987, Charles D. Moody, Sr., was appointed the university’s first Vice Provost for Minority Affairs (VPMA). Dr. Moody, a professor of education and director of the Program for Educational Opportunity in the School of Education since 1970, had long been active in the area of minority issues, especially education for underprivileged youths. As VPMA, he was given the responsibility for developing programs to aid the University of Michigan in the recruitment and retention of minority students, faculty, and staff, and for creating and staffing an Office of Minority Affairs to assist in these goals.</p>
      <p>Previously these duties had been the responsibility of the associate vice president for academic affairs. This position had been vacant since Niara Sudarkasa’s departure in January 1987 to become president of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. The impetus for the elevation of this position to the executive level and the addition of an Office of Minority Affairs is found in the campus events of February and March 1987.</p>
      <p>In February 1987, a group of students, concerned with the increasing number of acts of racism occurring on campus and frustrated at the apparent lack of action by the administration, formed the United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR). UCAR developed a list of twelve demands designed to provide long-term, institutional mechanisms to combat racism at the university, one of which was the establishment of an Office of Minority Affairs with an autonomous supervisory commission elected by the minority campus community. These demands were presented to President Shapiro on March 5, 1987, following a march to the Fleming Building. At this time, students stated that, unless the demands were met, it would be necessary to organize a third Black Action Movement (BAM III). Previous Black Action Movements, BAM I and BAM II, had taken place in 1970 and 1975; BAM I succeeded in crippling the university for thirteen days through boycotts of classes and work.</p>
      <p>BAM III was launched on March 18, 1987, with a march by over 350 students to the Diag, a rally, and a boycott of the Michigan Union. Also, BAM III presented a list of eleven demands to the administration, which incorporated the demands developed by UCAR. On March 20, members of UCAR, protesting the lack of action on their demands, staged a sit-in at the Fleming Building. Aware that Rev. Jesse Jackson was visiting the Detroit area, BAM III invited him to speak to the students and assist them in their efforts. After 24 hours of negotiations with Jackson acting as mediator, student representatives, President Shapiro, and university administrators announced a Six-Point Plan of Action. One of the points stated that the position of associate vice president for academic affairs would be elevated to the vice provost level with responsibility for an Office of Minority Affairs.</p>
      <p>Dr. Moody was the vice provost for minority affairs from his appointment in 1987 until June 1993, when he was appointed executive director of the university’s South Africa Initiative Office. His successor, Lester Monts, assumed the position with the new title of Vice Provost for Academic and Multicultural Affairs (VPAMA). This title reflected the expansion of the responsibilities of the position, including administrative oversight of the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching and the Reserve Officer Training Corps, as well as oversight of the Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives (the new name for the Office of Minority Affairs). When the Office of New Student Programs was created in 1995, it also reported to the vice provost for academic and multicultural affairs.</p>
      <p>In 1997 Dr. Monts' title was changed to Associate Provost for Academic and Multicultural Affairs; again his office took on additional responsibilities, including oversight of the offices of Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid and the Registrar. Monts’ title was changed again in January 2001 to Senior Vice Provost for Academic and Multicultural Affairs.</p>
      <p>(The events on campus leading up to the creation of the Office of Minority Affairs and the Vice Provost for Minority Affairs position are well documented in February and March 1987 issues of the student newspaper <title render="italic">The Michigan Daily</title>, and in the six Special Editions of <title render="italic">The University Record</title>, the newspaper for faculty and staff, published in March and April 1987.)</p>

      <p>The records of the Vice Provost for Academic and Multicultural Affairs document the activities and functions of the office from its creation in 1987 through 2000. The record group has been received in increments over the years, with some overlap in content between different accessions; the researcher may want to consult the files in multiple accessions to ensure receiving the most complete account of a particular subject. Some scattered records predating the formal establishment of the office are present in the early accessions. The record group consists of records of Vice Provost Charles D. Moody, Sr. and Lester Monts relating to work of the Office; series concern relations of office with outside organizations as well as activities within the university. It also includes administrative files, chronological files, and files on units reporting to the Office such as Military Officer Education Programs and Undergraduate Admissions.</p>
      <p>While the earlier accessions mainly concern the vice provost’s involvement in multicultural affairs, later accessions include information on the office’s broader academic affairs responsibilities, including administrative oversight of various student academic services. It should be noted that, for the most part, folder headings assigned by the vice provost’s office have been retained, and reflect the use of terms such as “African Americans,” “Blacks,” “Hispanics,” and “Latinos” by the office.</p>
