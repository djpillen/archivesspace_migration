      <p>The Law School of the University of Michigan was founded in October 1859. Earlier in April of the same year, the Regents appropriated $2,000 for the establishment of a law library. In addition, in October 1859, Judge Thomas M. Cooley of Detroit donated 350 volumes to the library. These volumes formed the basis of the library's collection. During the 19th century the Law Library received three major gifts; one from Judge Richard Fletcher of Boston in 1866 of 800 volumes, and two others from Detroit businessman Christian H. Buhl. In 1886 Buhl donated his personal library of over 5,000 volumes to the Law Library. This increased the size of the collection to nearly 10,000 volumes. In 1894 Buhl gave the library $10,000. With this bequest the library was able to increase substantially the scope of its collection. In 1929, William Cook, a beneficiary of the Law School, donated his entire personal collection to the library, and had the room in which his collection had been housed reconstructed in the library to house the material there.</p>
      <p>Originally the collection consisted mainly of reports from Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, and some New England states. The early focus of the library's collection was judicial decisions rather than acts of legislatures. However, in 1886, the library began a campaign to obtain statutes from all states in the Union. The money received from the Buhl bequest also helped the library to purchase and develop a section on foreign law. Up to that time the library held volumes relating only to American and English law. Throughout the early 20th century, acquisition of materials concerning foreign law and international law gave the library one of the best collections in the United States.</p>
      <p>The first three law librarians, Isaac Marston, Levi L. Barbour, and William R. Day, were all students in the Law School. Joseph H. Vance served as the first full-time librarian from 1883 to 1899. In 1899, Judge Victor Lane became the law librarian and presided over a collection of roughly 18,000 volumes. He did not oversee the administrative duties of the library, but rather concentrated on teaching, research, and collection development. The day-to-day activities of the library were the responsibilities of his assistant librarians: Gertrude Woodard (1901-1915), Elizabeth Steere (1915-1918), Blanche Harroun (1918-1924), and Rebecca Wilson (1924-1927). These women, led by Woodard, brought the collection under organizational control through the use of modern library principles and practices. Professor Hobart R. Coffey succeeded Judge Lane as law librarian, a position he held from 1926 to 1966. By 1937 the library contained 133,000 volumes. Professor Coffey's assistant librarian, Esther Betz, worked at the library from 1927 to 1963. Professor Beverly Pooley became the law librarian in 1965, a position he held until 1985. From 1985 until 1995 Pooley served as associate dean of the Law Library. Margaret Leary became director of the library in 1985. In 2011 Barbara H. Garavaglia moved from assistant director to full director of the Law Library.</p>
      <p>The Law Library was first located in the south wing of University Hall and then moved to the Law Building in 1863. The library moved to its present location, the William W. Cook Legal Research Building, in 1931. After much debate, the library underwent major renovation in 1980 to expand into the area underneath the Legal Research Building. The award-winning underground addition to the Law Library was designed by architect Gunnar Birkerts. In 1986 the library was officially designated as the Allen F. and Alene Smith Law Library.</p>
      <p>The Law Library's purpose is to build collections and provide services to support the teaching and research needs of Law School faculty and students. The Law Library's collections, services, and policies are primarily designed to benefit the Law School's faculty and students, and others officially connected with the Law School. The Law Library's secondary users are other University of Michigan faculty and students who have legitimate need to use the collection, and attorneys. As of 2013, the Law Library held 1,044,561 total volumes in both paper and microform format. Current information on the Law Library is available at the following URL: http://www.law.umich.edu/library/</p>
      <p>For more information on the Law School, researchers are advised to examine the Law School record group also housed at the Bentley Historical Library.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Library Building Addition subseries includes documents related to the major renovation that occurred in 1980. Of particular importance is the debate whether or not to construct the new library underground. In addition to the manuscript materials is one folder of architectural drawings. The drawings relate to proposals from various architects for the library building addition. The drawings include exterior elevations, plot plans, and renderings of interiors. Additional material on the design of the award-winning underground addition to the library may be found in the records of Gunnar Birkerts and Associates. Birkerts designed the addition and the records of his architectural firm are held at the Bentley Library.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the Library Building Addition files were added in 2006. These files include Building Committee Files which contain all materials related to the library addition, including correspondence between library administration and the architect, Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, as well as questionnaires, reports, and sketches of proposed additions to the law library. This collection also houses newspaper clippings and published articles related to the University of Michigan's project, compared to other academic library additions being built during this same period. The Student Building Committee is also represented in this collection.</p>

This includes primarily correspondence with other institutes because the library was interested in purchasing materials, confirming or cancelling a subscription, or because the library was attempting to complete collections of documents or magazines that were only partially held at the library.</p>

          <p>The Collections series is made up of material that was previously held at the Law Library in their collections but was then removed and donated to the Bentley Historical Library. This includes various documents, such as Law School publications, and notes on various lectures that were given at the university by James Campbell and James B. Angell. Significant material on <title render="italic">the Michigan Law Review</title> is contained here, including founding documents, article of associations, minutes, and a history file containing correspondence from several notable figures. Correspondents include Supreme Court justices Louis Brandeis, James Byrnes, and Harlan Stone as well as Attorney General Francis Biddle, Senator Arthur Vandenberg, and alumnus John D. Voelker.</p>
          <p>Within this is a subseries of Collected Late 18th and 19th Century Documents. In 1984, the law library added these documents to their holdings at the Bentley, which it had received from various sources, mainly former faculty and alumni. Included are various legal instruments, certificates of indenture, commissions, and appointments. There is also a register of cases prepared by law student Dwight May, and a volume of a law periodical kept by Albert J. Chapman. Many of the documents are oversize.</p>

          <p>The Audio Visual series includes photographs, slides, cassette tapes, and audio reels. The photograph section includes those taken of the construction of the new building on January 10, 1980 and outsize mounted photographs taken by Balthazar Korab of proposed models of the new building. The slides consist of around 250 slides of alternative schemes for the law school additions, and details of the law school, proposed library additions, and the built addition.</p>
          <p>In 1990, sound recordings of the Thomas M. Cooley, William W. Bishop, and William W. Cook Lectures were added to the Law Library's records. Additional records of these lectures, including correspondence pertaining to arrangements along with programs and printed copies of the presentation may be found in the University of Michigan Law School records also held by the Bentley.</p>
          <p>A second set of audio-visual material was added to the collection in 2014. This includes glass plate slides of the library and the law school buildings, and negatives of individuals collected from a number of sources, among them secondary sources. Cassette tapes are also included which have the recordings of various lectures, including from the Cook and Cooley lecture series' and from lectures given by James White. Also included are audio reel-to-reel tapes that contain recordings of presentations at conferences, including the Institute on Advocacy and the Institute on Improving the Method of Judicial Selection in Michigan.</p>

          <p>The Law School series contains documents that were donated to the Law Library but were related to the Law School rather than a particular aspect of the library. This includes announcements, flyers, directories, scrapbooks (located in outsize material), and two subseries. The Michigan Law Review subseries includes chronological issues, lists of authors, and meeting minutes. The second subseries contains information on the Lawyer's Club, a group of students within the Law School that is centered around the exclusive housing within the Law Quadrangle. The Lawyer's Club's files contain documentation including blueprints for the building, publications, rules of housing, and a series of student notebooks from alumnus Allan Rubin.</p>
