      <p>The University of Michigan Personnel Office was established on January 26, 1945. The office formally reports to the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. Among the Personnel Office's many responsibilities are the development and implementation of the university's personnel policies, administration of the faculty promotion and tenure granting process, and negotiation and administration of contracts with unionized university employees. It also maintains the official employment record for all faculty and staff. In compliance with the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, the Personnel Office makes salary information for all university employees available to the public (The annually published salary list is located in the University of Michigan Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action publications record group).</p>
      <p>The Personnel Office develops and implements personnel policies for the University of Michigan. The office establishes the guidelines that govern the hiring and firing of all university staff, including academic faculty. The salary grades which determine an employee's initial compensation are based on the skills necessary to fill a position as well as previous experience relating to that position.</p>
      <p>Recommendations for faculty promotions and granting of tenure are initiated by the department, college or school. These recommendations are transmitted through the Personnel Office to the president and provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, and then to the Board of Regents for final action.</p>
      <p>The Personnel Office is the university's agent in labor negotiations with various staff and professional bargaining units. In the late 1950s, the University adopted a policy of neutrality with regards to employee union activities. Employees were allowed to seek union representation in grievance and other procedures. However, the university still refused to recognize any one union to speak for all employees, and thus refused to bargain collectively. At this time, the university saw an upswing in union activity, with the Association of Federal, State, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Local 1583, at the forefront. The Building Service Employees' International Union (BSEIU), Local 378, was also active on campus at this time.</p>
      <p>In 1965, another surge in activity took place following the state's revision of the Hutchinson Act, recognizing the right of government employees to bargain collectively. In 1968, the Michigan Labor Mediation Board recognized the University's service and maintenance employees as an appropriate collective bargaining unit. These employees soon elected AFSCME to represent them. The first union contract signed by the university became effective September 13, 1968. The complexities of these negotiations can be seen in the events of 1970 when graduate student assistants petitioned the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) for recognition of a collective bargaining unit. The university argued that if graduate students were to be considered employees, they did not compose a bargaining unit by themselves, but rather were a component part of several larger bargaining units. Without ruling on the employment issue, MERC dismissed the student petition based on the university's second argument.</p>
      <p>In February 1994, the Personnel Office and the Affirmative Action Office were combined into a new entity, Human Resources and Affirmative Action (HRAA).</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>The Personnel Office records comprise 31 linear feet and span a wide range of years from the 1940s to the early 1990s. The records document the activities of the office prior to its 1994 consolidation with the Affirmative Action Office. The office is now part of Human Resources and Affirmative Action. The records have been filed as received from the unit in periodic accessions. As such there is considerable overlap in topics covered and dates of coverage within the various records series. Files relating to specific promotion and tenure cases are in a separate record group, University of Michigan Office of Human Resources and Affirmative Action Promotion Casebooks. A finding aid for these records is available in the Bentley Library.</p>
      <p>The records of the Personnel Office are divided into nine series: Topical Files of Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs: Charles Allmand; Topical Files of Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs-Personnel Administration: Colleen Dolan-Greene; Personnel Data Systems (PDS) Files; Graduate Student Assistants (GSA)/Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) Files; Memoranda to Deans, Directors, and Department Heads; Administrative Files, 1980-1992; Administrative Files, 1970-1994; Labor Relations, and Administrative Files, 1963-1994.</p>

          <p>The Topical Files series originate from the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. In 1986 the title of the office was changed from Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs to Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs-Personnel Administration, although responsibilities remained the same. The series is divided into two subseries reflecting the tenure of the two individuals who held the office: Charles Allmand, 1969-1985 and Colleen Dolan Greene, 1986-1993. Both subseries reflect the wide ranging responsibilities of the Personnel Office within the University of Michigan infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Graduate Student Assistants (GSA)/Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) Files (8 linear ft.) series dates from 1949 to 1985 (primarily 1974 to 1980). The records deal with the Personnel Office's relationship with GEO and, to a limited extent, earlier attempts to unionize graduate student assistants. The material has been arranged into three sub series. The Chronological Files measure seven feet and makes up the bulk of the records. It is supplemented by a second sub series, Miscellaneous Material and a third sub series, Arbitration/Grievances.</p>

            <p>The Administrative Files, 1970-1994, are arranged alphabetically by topic or office name. Received in 1997, this subseries overlaps with the previously received administrative files series. Many of these files derive from offices within the Personnel Department, and consist primarily of monthly reports or reports and memos on specific subjects. Informative summary material on personnel activities can be found in the "Audits and Reviews," "Personnel Office--Reorganization," and "Personnel Office--Long Range Planning" files.</p>

          <p>The Labor Relations series is a rich source of information concerning the numerous unions on campus, their attempts to organize employees, and their demands on behalf of members. The series also documents the reactions and tactics of the Personnel Department staff and other university administrators. The subseries "History of Labor Relations at the University of Michigan" records the university's official stance towards unions from the late 1930s to the early 1970s, with emphasis on the 1960s. Within this subseries, The "Regents' Meetings Personnel Policies, 1937-1967" file is a useful summary, excerpting from the minutes of the board those decisions which affected labor relations or personnel policy. This subseries also documents the administration's reaction to the Hutchinson Act of 1965, and the subsequent upswing in union activity.</p>
          <p>The rest of the series is arranged alphabetically, and consists of files which correspond to specific unions, or specific groups of employees and their attempts to organize. Of special interest is the file relating to the Student Employees' Association and the file entitled "Faculty Unions". Activities of the Association of Federal, State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Local 1583, are well documented for the years 1958 to 1968, especially 1958 to 1961. The union made demands on behalf of its entire membership, as well as on behalf of individual employees with specific grievances. The Personnel Office also collected fliers and news clippings related to this union. Relations with the Building Service Employees' International Union (BSEIU), Local 378 are documented from 1966 to 1968. However, files covering the years 1949 to 1966 were destroyed in 1968. In 1970, the Teamster's Union challenged AFSCME for right to represent service and maintenance employees, and the file "Teamsters' Organizing Drive" documents this event.</p>
