      <p>While the University of Michigan made its first provisions for graduate study in 1845, throughout most of the nineteenth century there were few graduate students to educate. Control of graduate programs was vested in the various university departments. University President James B. Angell advocated, in the late nineteenth century, the establishment of a graduate school, and in the academic year 1891/92 his goal was partially achieved when the College of Literature, Science and the Arts established a separate Graduate Department.</p>
      <p>The Graduate Department was unable to coordinate graduate programs outside of the college. To make such coordination possible, the Regents established a university Graduate Department during the academic year 1911/12. This department was independent of any special faculty and was granted its own budget. Its primary purposes were to coordinate graduate education and to promote research. In 1915, through a general university revision of titles, the department became the Graduate School.</p>
      <p>As part of its responsibility for promoting research, the Graduate School was made responsible for all university publications in 1913. As early as 1920 the school's governing board advocated the establishment of a separate university press. This was done in 1930, and responsibility for university publications was gradually transferred to the Administrative Committee of the University Press. The final transfer of authority occurred in 1935.</p>
      <p>More important than its role of university printer was the responsibility of the Graduate School to dispense university research funds. Most general fund expenses for research, notably the Faculty Research Fund, flowed through the Graduate School, as did many private gifts received by the university to further research. In order to better coordinate the expenditure of this money, President Alexander G. Ruthven suggested in 1929 the establishment of university-wide divisional committees. These interdisciplinary advisory bodies came to have great importance in deciding which requests for support would be funded.</p>
      <p>In 1935 the Graduate School's prestige and resources were substantially increased by the bequest of Horace H. Rackham. A total of 6.5 million dollars was received. Four million dollars was put aside as a perpetual endowment, the Horace H. and Mary A. Rackham fund, while the remainder was used to construct a suitable building to house the Graduate School, now renamed the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. The Rackham Building was dedicated June 17, 1938.</p>
      <p>In addition to dispensing research funds, the Graduate School coordinated the efforts of major research projects that were not governed by any other university unit. Examples are the Institute of Public and Social Administration (IPSA), founded in 1936 (now the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy), and the Bureau of Government, administered by the IPSA. Another example is the Institute for Human Adjustment (IHA), which at its founding in 1937 administered four major programs, the Fresh Air Camp, the Speech Clinic, the Social Science Research Project, and the Bureau of Psychological Services. In 1951 the Division of Gerontology was created under the IHA. A final example is the Statistical Research Laboratory (SRL), founded in 1946. In 1959 the Computing Center was created as a separate division of the SRL. The burden of administration created by overseeing so many large projects proved troublesome. In the 1960s the Graduate School attempted to find suitable university units to become responsible for the oversight of many of these large projects.</p>
      <p>Another reason for the transfer of projects was that during the 1950s the Graduate School became a central coordinating body for all university research, taxing the school's resources. In academic year 1947/48 the Committee on Budget Administration of the university directed that all university trust funds supporting research be reported to the Graduate School. In 1959 a vice-president for research was established within the university, the position to be held by the dean of the Graduate School. The decision to combine the posts of vice-president and dean in one person was reversed in the academic year 1964/65. (The positions were temporarily merged for several years in the mid 1980s under Dean Alfred Sussman and then separated again when John D'Arms assumed the deanship of Rackham.)</p>
      <p>From the post World War II period until the 1970s the federal government continually increased the amount of funding available from it for research. Most of this money, however, was channeled to scientific and technical areas. To compensate for this imbalance, the Graduate School funneled most university research funds into the humanities and the social sciences. University research money given to scientific and technical areas tended to be seed money, funds to help a faculty member perform basic research necessary to attract a larger, non-university grant.</p>
      <p>In 1990, the positions of Dean of Rackham and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs were combined to reflect the close relationship between the Office of the Provost and the Graduate School (later the title of the dean's supplemental administrative appointment was modified to Vice Provost for Academic Affairs -- Graduate Studies). In this dual role, the Dean of Rackham was involved in a number of initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s at the university, including the development of the Institute for the Humanities in 1987 and the reorganization of international programs at the university and establishment of the International Institute in 1993. Within Rackham in the late-1990s, there was a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary initiatives, including the development of the Rackham Summer Interdisciplinary Institute and the Rackham Interdisciplinary Seminars, both in 1997.</p>

      <p>The records of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies document the administration of the school, its academic programs and research projects and fellowships funded by the school and outside sources. The records include Dean's Files, minutes of the Executive Board and Administrative Council, Academic Unit and Program Evaluation files, and grants administration records.</p>
      <p>Records of the Graduate School have been received by the library in numerous accessions, some large others quite small. Some accessions represent continuations or complements to previously received materials. This finding attempts to intellectually integrate continuing or similar record series received in multiple accessions.</p>
      <p>The records are organized into a number of series. Among the more significant are: <list type="simple"><item>Deans' Topical File</item><item>Research Records</item><item>University Units</item><item>Program Evaluations</item><item>Faculty Research Grants</item><item>Degree Lists</item><item>Faculty Fellowships, Grants and Awards</item><item>Graduate School Executive Board and Administrative Council</item></list> </p>
      <p>In 2008, the Rackham School of Graduate Studies announced that it would become a 'paperless' office and that future accessions to the Bentley Library would be electronic. The materials from 1990 to 2003 were thus digitized by Rackham staff (from the original paper records) and saved as PDF (Portable Document Format) files. As of 2012, these digital accessions comprise two subseries within the Graduate School Executive Board and Administrative Council series and Program Evaluation series.</p>

          <p>The Dean's Topical files series is the principal administrative file of the school. It includes correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes of committees, and files relating to academic departments and programs. The series dates from the founding of the school in 1892 through 2010. Dean's Topical have been transferred to the library in multiple accessions and are subdivided into subseries reflecting those accessions. Occasionally an accession represents the files of a single dean, but more frequently a subseries will span the tenure of several deans. There is frequently considerable overlap in the time periods covered by the various subseries. Within each subseries, the files are arranged alphabetically.</p>

            <p>The original accession of Dean's Topical Files is divided into two subseries, 1892-1958, and 1958-1985. The year 1958 represents a general point of division between the two files, but not an absolute one. In particular some pre-1958 material can occasionally be found in the subseries 1958-1985. Among the more significant subjects are the budget, Bureau of Government, Early Modern English Dictionary, Executive Board agendas and minutes, Institute for Public and Social Administration, Rackham Building construction, Statistical Research Laboratory, Dissertation Review Committee, Inteflex, and the Michigan Council of Graduate Deans. Another small accession of 1958-1985 was received later.</p>

            <p>The 1970-1971 subseries of the Dean's Topical Files contains a small run of files from dean Steven Spurr which were transferred from the Office of Vice President for Academic Affairs. The files include documentation on minority issues, including programs aimed at Black, Chicano, and Native American students. Financial aid concerns are also addressed, including files on barring students involved in campus protests and disruptions from receiving federal aid.</p>

            <p>Dean's Topical Files, 1972-1999 subseries (8 linear feet) continues the series from previous accessions. The files in this subseries span the years from 1972 to 1999, with the bulk of the material from 1989 to 1995. Most date from the deanship of John D'Arms (1985-1995), but small amounts of material from Interim Dean Robert Weisbuch (1995-1996), and Deans Nancy Cantor (1996-1997) and Earl Lewis (1997-1999) are also included. A researcher interested in the organizational structure of Rackham during this time period should consult the files within this series that specifically relate to Rackham as an organization, including the Dean's Briefing Book and Rackham External Administrative Review from 1996, and the Rackham Briefing Book from 1999.</p>
            <p>Of particular note are the agendas, minutes, and supporting materials from the Rackham Deans Meetings, which lend insight into the major issues and priorities of Rackham during this time period. Also prominent is administrative correspondence between the Dean and the academic units, centers, and programs under his/her budgetary control or with which the dean had significant involvement. These units include the Institute for the Humanities, the Museum of Art, the University of Michigan Press, and the Michigan Journalism Fellows program.</p>

            <p>The Associate Dean for Student Recruitment and Support subseries (5 linear feet) is broken up into two sub-subseries, Topical Files and University Units. The files span the years from 1981 to 1996, with the bulk from 1989 to 1994. During the period from which these files originate, this office had primary responsibility for developing programs to support graduate student recruitment and retention, with an emphasis at the Associate Dean level on minority student recruitment and retention. The Associate Dean for Student Recruitment and Support reported directly to the Dean of Rackham. This subseries provides an in-depth look at the variety of strategies employed to encourage minority graduate students to apply and matriculate to the University of Michigan. The Topical Files include funding proposals, reports, and correspondence related to these initiatives. The University Units files contain correspondence with academic schools, departments, and programs about funding, recruitment, and program evaluation.</p>

            <p>Project Files represent the extant material documenting each individual project funded through the Graduate School. Typical files contain a grant proposal, and progress or final reports. Administrative papers (letter of authorization, invoices, detailed financial statements, etc.) are generally not included in the file, although such items become more common as files become more current. Project Files are divided into two units, Major Grant Programs and Minor Grant Programs. Placement of a particular grant program is arbitrary, generally based on the number of grants awarded and the years documented. Arrangement within each unit is alphabetical, by name of grant program. Each grant program is usually arranged by grant number, the two major exceptions being Rackham Publication Grants, which are arranged alphabetically by the name of the grant recipient.</p>

          <p>The University Units series consists largely of printed materials (brochures, annual reports, etc.) and correspondence and reports on the teaching, curriculum, and funding of graduate courses. The series is subdivided chronologically (reflecting the multiple accession in which materials were received) but there is temporal overlap among the subseries. Each of the subseries is arranged in five sub-subseries: Branch Campuses (Dearborn and Flint), Centers, Institutes, Interdepartmental/Interdisciplinary Programs (IDPs), and Schools and Colleges. The IDPs subseries is particularly interesting for the light it sheds on the emphasis on interdisciplinary education and research.</p>

            <p>The bulk of the University Units, 1977-2009 subseries consists of materials relating to the Rackham Summer Interdisciplinary Institute (RSII). RSII was first held in 1998 and consisted of a five-week program with twenty faculty and ten graduate students completing readings and attending weekly sessions involving small group and general discussions on a wide range of topics in interdisciplinary studies, in particular how to support interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching. Materials include faculty and student application files as well as annual files containing correspondence, budget information, agendas and meeting notes, selection process information, and reports. Other units represented in this series include the Clements Library, engineering program, University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA), and the Psychological Clinic.</p>

            <p>The Program Evaluation series (11.5 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically by department or program. The records, spanning 1978-1992, principally contain material relating to the periodic evaluations of the various departments and interdepartmental programs administered by Rackham. The evaluations are performed to analyze both successful and unsuccessful features of the programs. There is information on the entire evaluation process, from the organization of the review committee to the preparation of the committee's final report. The report contains a brief history of the department or program, a discussion of its nature and costs, and recommendations for improvements. Other material in the series includes memos concerning the implementation of changes proposed by the review committees; statistical data about enrollment; and student, faculty, and alumni questionnaires, which assess the success of programs.</p>
            <p>The digital files in the Program Evaluation series are functionally related to earlier content collected and maintained by Carole Berlin, the former Rackham administrator responsible for the Program Evaluation Office within the Rackham Graduate School. The digital materials in this series include evaluations of graduate programs at U-M Dearborn and U-M Flint as well as at the main Ann Arbor campus. Documents are scanned versions of original paper records.</p>

            <p>The Program Evaluation, 1991-2007 subseries consists of two sub-subseries, National Research Council Assessment and Reviews. The National Research Council Assessment files pertain to a 2005-2007 study to assess and rank research-doctorate programs, primarily through questionnaires administered to institutions, programs, and faculty. Materials includes program questionnaires, faculty lists, and correspondence relating to the study. The Reviews sub-subseries documents efforts to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of various programs and includes both external and internal review committee reports, student and graduate survey results, funding and admission statistics, program proposals, and program annual reports.</p>

Furthermore, a large amount of statistics dating back to the early part of the twentieth century documents graduate degree information.</p>

            <p>The Administrative Files, 1971-2010 subseries is divided into seven sub-subseries: Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP), Dean's Group Files, Financial, Meetings, Rackham Renovation Records, Searches, and University Press. AGEP, formerly known as the Minority Graduate Education Program, is a program funded by the National Science Foundation to advance minority students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and Social Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and prepare them for faculty positions in these areas. These files include budget materials, proposals, reports, and correspondence concerning the program. The Dean's Group Files documents the activities of the dean's group, which includes the associate and assistant deans and meets at least once a month to review financial and other administrative matters, and contains agendas, reports, and other meeting materials. The Financial sub-subseries contain budget and funding files, including several relating to block grants, which can be used by Rackham programs for fellowships, summer support, recruitment activities, research support, and research related travel. The Meetings subseries includes minutes, agendas, and reports from the Executive Board, Rackham Leadership Team, and other groups. The Rackham Renovation Records files consists of records relating to the renovation of the building in the early 2000s, including architectural drawings, budget material, and correspondence. Searches contains files on searches for deans, associate deans, and assistant deans. The subseries of the University Press, which used to be a subordinate unit of Rackham, includes records relating to its finances, facilities, and personnel.</p>

          <p>The degree lists series lists the names of students awarded graduate degrees, from the first graduate degrees granted in 1849 and extending through August 1994. The series provides a unique glimpse of the Graduate School, its growth through the years; the change in Rackham's demographics over the years; and the changes in the fields represented at Rackham. The series is organized in three subseries: Degree Lists - Chronological, Degree Lists - Field of Study, and Doctoral Degree Lists.</p>

            <p>The Degree Lists - Chronological subseries (4 linear feet) lists the degrees granted, organized chronologically by year. Beginning in October 1877, the graduates are listed by semester and year in which the degrees were granted. The individual entries list the first and last name, and later the entries include any previous degrees received and the degree granting institution. The graduates are generally listed alphabetically by last name. In the cases of doctoral degrees, the individual entries also include the field of study and the thesis title.</p>
            <p>The subseries covers the 1848/49 school year through September 1938 inclusively. An additional volume, which covers the 1937/38 and 1938/39 school years duplicates some earlier information, but also includes listings of graduates in 1939, which are not included in the previous volumes. The volume is divided into the two school years, and then sub-divided into fields; the individual entries are arranged alphabetically. The individual entries list the first initial, middle initial and last name of the graduate, and have a note in the column under the degree received.</p>
            <p>After a gap of eight years, the degree lists resume in February 1947 continuing through August 1994. Notable during this period is the first appearance of a listing for graduate degrees granted at the Dearborn campus in May 1971; and the first appearance of a listings for graduate degrees granted at the Flint campus in April 1979. Between the years of 1947 until December 1975, the individual entries are listed as full name, previous degrees received, previous degree granting institutions. The entries are listed alphabetically. The doctoral degrees also include the field of study and thesis title. The individual listings are arranged under the degree received. Beginning in May 1976, the individual listings are grouped first by the granting college, then by the degree granted. The series contains a second gap stretching between April 1991 until April 1993, when the series resumes. The individual listing scheme and arrangement of the individual listings continues as before. The portion of the series between April 1984 and August 1994 is restricted because the documents contain student identification numbers.</p>

            <p>The subseries Degree Lists - Field of Study (2 linear feet) lists the degrees granted organized by field of study, grouped by the four divisions used by Rackham for internal administration purposes, with separate lists for each semester and year in which degrees were granted. The four divisions of Rackham are: Division I - Biological and health sciences, Division II - Physical sciences, geology and engineering, Division III - Social sciences and education, and Division IV - Arts and humanities. The lists cover 118 fields granting graduate degrees at the University. The inclusive dates for Division I are 1914/1915 to August 1994. The inclusive dates for Division II are April 1967 to August 1994. The inclusive dates for Division III are May 1974 to August 1994. The inclusive dates for Division IV are 1913/14 to August 1994. The semesters are arranged in reverse chronological order. The order for the individual listings are: full name in reverse alphabetical order, student ID number, and degree type. The series also includes lists of the total number of degrees awarded, by field, between December 1992 through August 1994. The lists for degrees granted after 1980 are restricted because they include student identification numbers.</p>
            <p>A second set of lists arranged alphabetically by field of study covers the years of 1890/1891 through June 1953. It was created separately from the later lists organized by division and field. These listings are arranged alphabetically by field; then broken down chronologically by the year the degree was granted; then at the individual level, alphabetically by last name. The individual listings are: first name, middle initial, last name, with an x placed in the proper column for the degree granted</p>

            <p>The Doctoral Degree Lists (1 linear foot) are found in two different arrangements in two different locations. Doctoral degrees awarded between 1876 and 1912 are listed separately from the master's degree lists, chronologically by year. The individual entries are listed alphabetically by last name, and include: last name, first and middle name, degree with month and year awarded, the granting department, and thesis title. Doctoral degrees awarded between 1912 and 1955 are listed by field of study, alphabetically, and the individual entries include the same information as the entries from the period 1876 to 1912.</p>
            <p>The separate listings for doctoral degrees have a gap between 1955 through December 1992. The general doctoral degree listings resume in December 1992 and continue through December 1994. Each semester contains a summary list of the total number of degrees awarded, listed alphabetically by field of study. The individual entries are organized alphabetically by field of study and grouped alphabetically by last name. The individual entry includes: student ID number, full name, division, field of study, program level degree code, and degree name. The lists covering December 1992 through August 1994 are restricted because the entries contain student identification numbers. However, a separate listing exists, covering December 1993 to December 1994, which is not restricted. A separate listing covers the years of 1974-1976 for dissertations arising out of the School of Education. Individual listings include: full name, degree, date granted, and dissertation title. The individual listings are organized first under dissertation chairman, then by date awarded.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the doctoral degrees are integrated into the master's degree lists to form a general graduate degree list. The doctoral degrees are found in Degree Lists - Chronological series listed similarly with the master's degrees. The lists cover the 1848/1849 school year through September 1938. The list resumes in February 1947 through May 1973. There are no doctoral degrees listed with the August 1973 degrees, but the list continues in December 1973 through August 1976. The integration of the doctoral degrees into the general graduate degree lists continues in the Degree Lists - Field of Study series. Doctoral degrees are included in the lists covering 1890/1891 to 1953, and the field of study lists that cover the period between 1979 and December 1985.</p>

            <p>The subseries Minority Faculty Development Fund (1.5 linear feet) comprises the applications for funding from faculty, evaluations of the applications, as well as lists of accepted and denied requests. The individual application files include: requests, vitaes, support letters, and correspondence. These files are arranged in alphabetical order by the applicant's last name. The fund was established to assist departments in the professional development and retention of minority faculty, through cost sharing and cooperation with the individual units of the University. The funds can be put to a wide ranging number of uses, including: travel funds, seed money for research, and promoting collaborative research. These boxes are restricted, because they contain evaluative material referring to faculty members.</p>

            <p>The subseries Distinguished University Professorships (0.5 linear foot) contains dossiers on 16 faculty members nominated for distinguished professorships at the University. The professorships cover a diverse number of subjects. The nominations occurred between 1987 and 1995. The individual files contain nomination letters, curriculum vitae, and recommendation letters. The files are arranged in alphabetical order by the nominee's last name. The professors are nominated for their expertise in their fields. This series is restricted, because it contains evaluative material referring to faculty members.</p>

            <p>The Power Exchange Program subseries (0.5 linear foot) contains dossiers on 20 students involved in the exchange program, as well as files relating to the administration of the program by the University. The individual files contain transcripts, applications, and correspondence. The files are arranged in alphabetical order by the student's last name. The program originated in 1968, supported by the Power Foundation. Each year the University of Michigan selects one student to study for a master's degree at Cambridge University (UK), and Cambridge selects one student to study at the University of Michigan in a master's degree program. The fund provides tuition and fees, stipend, books, travel expenses, and health care for the period of time required to receive the degree, normally two years. The collection contains those dossiers for students selected beginning in 1982 through 1995. This series is restricted, because it contains student educational records with sensitive information.</p>

            <p>The subseries South African Mid-Career Fellowship (0.5 linear foot) contains a file regarding the development of the program, as well as the files on the 14 fellows who came to the university under the program. The purpose of the fellowship was to increase the educational opportunity for black South Africans. The pilot program began in 1987, and was one of five hosted by other universities at that time. The fellowship provided funding for professionals to take leaves of absence from their jobs and come to study at the university for up to one year. This subseries is restricted, because it contains student educational records with sensitive information.</p>

            <p>The subseries International Partnerships Program (0.5 linear foot) comprises files which document the development of the program from its inception, including: program proposal, guidelines, and annual reports. Also included are the files for the yearly competition which contain lists of applicants, as well as the applications themselves and the accompanying evaluations. The program was established in 1980, by a grant from the Hewlett Foundation, and was administered by Rackham until it ended in 1987. The funds are for university faculty to develop research and teaching projects in collaboration with institutions and faculty in other countries. This subseries is restricted because it contains evaluative material relating to faculty members.</p>

            <p>The Raoul Wallenberg Medal and Lecture sub series (0.5 linear foot) encompasses files which document each lecture given between 1990 and 1995. The award was inaugurated in the Autumn of 1990, as the result of a university-wide effort to establish a tribute to Raoul Wallenberg. Wallenberg, a 1935 alumnus of the university's architecture program, saved tens of thousands of Jews in Hungary during the final years of WWII. He survived the Nazis, but disappeared into the Soviet gulag in 1945 and his whereabouts are unknown, although he is now presumed dead. The award and lectureship is bestowed annually by a committee which selects a contemporary humanitarian of international stature, "whose achievements embody Wallenberg's selfless commitment." Past recipients include Elie Wiesel, Miep Gies, Per Anger, and Tenzin Gyatso, the Dali Lama.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Panel on Allocation of Space for Student Organizations and University Involvement with Student Organizations series (1 linear foot) contains materials collected and generated by a special panel appointed by the President's Office in 2000 in response to a campus-wide controversy over the allocation of meeting and office space to student organizations. For a number of years, several groups on campus, including a controversial senior society called Michigamua, had held dedicated meeting rooms in the Michigan Union tower. In 2000, in a protest against Michigamua's use of Native American rituals and artifacts in their meetings and the university's perceived support for the group through the provision of dedicated meeting space, students from the Students of Color Coalition took over the tower rooms for five weeks from February 6 through March 13. Following the protest, President Bollinger announced the formation of the panel and charged it with examining two issues: 1) the University's policies and practices regarding space allocation to student organizations, with particular attention to whether any student organization should be entitled to space not subject to a periodic review process; and 2) the proper nature and scope of University involvement with student organizations. The panel's findings are included in this series, as are research materials, correspondence, and transcripts of two open forums held to gather public opinion.</p>
