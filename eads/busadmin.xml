    <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
      <p>The first formal reference to commercial education at the University of Michigan was made in 1900-01, with courses offered through the College of Literature, Science and the Arts' Department of Economics. The number of commercial courses in the department expanded steadily, and in 1904-05 a "Certificate of Commerce" was authorized for those who had specialized in the field. Growth, both in terms of students and courses continued, with a sudden upswing of interest immediately after World War I leading to the decision to create a separate School of Business Administration. Preliminary plans for the school were begun in 1922, but significant progress occurred after February 1923, with the hiring of Edmund Ezra Day as chairman of the Department of Economics. Day came to Michigan with an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and a Ph.D. from Harvard. He was authorized to found the new school which was formally established in 1924, with Day serving both as dean and also as Economics chairman. Day's tenure, however, was relatively short. He took a leave of absence during 1927-28, and formally resigned his post soon afterward to join the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
      <p>In Day's absence Clare E. Griffin, who was professor of marketing, was first named acting dean, and was formally appointed to the post in 1929. Griffin had received his undergraduate degree from Albion College and a Ph.D. from Illinois in 1918. Under Day and Griffin the school's curriculum was largely patterned after that of Harvard, focusing upon graduate education. Admission to the school was preceded by three years study in the liberal arts. The school awarded two degrees, a Master of Business Administration (MBA) and a doctorate (beginning in 1935). Perhaps because of the focus upon graduate education, the school did not follow the custom of the day in recruiting businessmen to serve as part-time faculty. Rather, a full-time, academically-trained, staff was retained.</p>
      <p>In addition to normal classroom activities Day and Griffin oversaw the creation of two special bureaus. The Bureau of Business Research was founded in 1925. Its purpose was to facilitate research by members of the faculty through the publication of scholarly work and also to facilitate teaching by developing and publishing case studies useful in class work. The Bureau of Industrial Relations was founded in 1935. Made possible by a gift from the Earhart Foundation, this Bureau was established in response to the growing complexity of employee-employer relations. At its annual conference, and through other devices, it brought together corporate representatives to discuss issues in labor and personnel relations.</p>
      <p>In 1944 Russell A. Stevenson replaced the retiring Griffin as dean. Stevenson had received his bachelor's degree from UM in 1913, studied at the University of Iowa from which he received a Master's degree in 1915, and then returned to Michigan for his doctorate, which was awarded in 1919. From 1920 to 1926 he headed the Department of Commerce at the University of Cincinnati. In 1927 he became dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Minnesota, the position he held until he came to Michigan.</p>
      <p>Stevenson refocused Michigan's curriculum towards undergraduate education. A Bachelor of Business Administration degree had been established in 1942, primarily to meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Stevenson developed and expanded this program, capitalizing on the influx of post-war students to build enrollment to a peak of 1,249 in 1949. Stevenson began the school's first off-campus credit program, improving the non-credit offerings that had been first made available through the university's Extension Service in 1938. By 1960, credit courses were being offered in Detroit, Grand Rapids and Midland.</p>
      <p>Despite his emphasis on undergraduate education, Stevenson did modestly expand the overall scope of the school's graduate program. In 1954 a new Master's degree in Hospital Administration was created, and in 1957 a Bureau of Hospital Administration was founded. Stevenson also obtained for the school its first adequate physical facilities. At its founding the school had been located in Tappan Hall, a site it shared with the College of Education and that, even in the 1920's was considered inadequate. Despite Tappan Hall's inadequacies, the school remained there until after World War II, when a new building was constructed on Monroe St.</p>
      <p>In addition to his academic activities, Stevenson served in several organizations and businesses. He was active in both the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business and the Economic Club of Detroit. He also served as a director for several commercial enterprises, most notably for Lear, Incorporated.</p>
      <p>In 1960 the retiring Stevenson was replaced by Floyd A. Bond. Like his predecessor, Bond had Michigan roots. All of his academic degrees were awarded to him by UM, a bachelor's degree in 1938, a master's in 1940 and a doctorate in 1942. Bond served on the UM Economics faculty from 1938 until 1946. From 1946 to 1948 he taught at Carleton College, and from 1948 until 1960 he served at Pomona College.</p>
      <p>Bond returned the Michigan's business administration program to its original emphasis upon graduate education. The MBA and Ph.D. programs were invigorated, and off-campus education was strengthened on the Dearborn and Flint satellite campuses by applying the same admission standards there as were used in Ann Arbor, both for day and evening students.</p>
      <p>Bond also established a number of new programs within the school. An Institute for International Commerce was established in 1966. Its creation, while not directly linked to other programs in the school, complemented foreign based outreach programs established with the National Chengchi University in Taiwan, the Netherlands School of Economics, and involvement in the University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia. The school's long-standing interest in bringing prominent individuals to campus to address students and faculty was furthered by the establishment of the Executive in Residence and Actuary in Residence program, as well as the creation of the McInally Lecture Endowment Fund, designed to establish an annual lecture at the school by a business figure of stature. In addition to the intellectual changes Bond brought to the school, he also oversaw the enlargement of the school's physical facilities. In 1972 an Assembly Hall, which included Hale Auditorium, was dedicated, and in 1976 the Paton Accounting Center was opened.</p>
      <p>In addition to his academic responsibilities, Bond served his profession in several other capacities. He was extremely active in the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, serving on the Standards Committee (1962-66), and Executive Committee (1963-71) and being elected president of the organization for 1968-69. Bond was a longtime member of the Economic Club of Detroit's Program Committee. He also served for a brief period (1959-60) as the director of the Center for Economic Development's Business-Education Division. In addition to these activities, in 1960 Bond traveled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation of economists invited to visit that nation by the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</p>
      <p>In 1979 Bond reached the mandatory retirement age for university administrators. While he continued to serve the school as a professor, he was succeeded as dean by Gilbert A. Whitaker, Jr. Whitaker had received his BA from Rice University, and his master's and doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1958 and 1961 respectively. Between 1960 and 1966 he served on the faculty at Northwestern University. In 1967 he joined the faculty at Washington University at St. Louis and in 1969 he was named the associate dean of the business school. In 1976 he left St. Louis to become dean of the M.J. Neeley School of Business at Texas Christian University. Whitaker was appointed Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs in 1990, and was succeeded by B. Joseph White.</p>
      <p>White served as dean from 1991 to 2001 and was succeeded by Robert J. Dolan. In 2005 the School of Business Administration was renamed the Ross School of Business in honor of Stephen M. Ross, a 1962 graduate of the school.</p>

      <p>The records of the Ross School of Business measure 110 linear feet (1916 to 1991) and are organized into five subgroups: Russell A. Stevenson and Predecessors (hereafter Stevenson); Floyd A. Bond (hereafter Bond); Gilbert A. Whitaker Files (span dates 1925-1991); Visual and Audio Materials; and Architectural Records. The subgroups have been further divided into series. Because of the complexity of the documentation most of the series are also divided into sub-series. The Stevenson series are: Deans Administrative Records, Supplemental Administrative Records, Relations with other University Units, and Personal Files. The Bond subgroup is divided into six series: Deans Administrative Files, Supplemental Administrative Files, Relations with other University Units, School records, and Personal. The Gilbert A. Whitaker subgroup has two series: Committees and Topical Files. Visual and Audio Materials contains five series: Photographs, Slides, Dividend Magazine, Photographs, Microfilm, and Audiotapes.</p>

          <p>The Stevenson subgroup dates from 1916 to 1960 (primarily 1924 to 1960). Most of its contents were created by Dean Stevenson, but some documents created by his predecessors, Deans Day and Griffin, are also found here. By far the largest and most complex of the four series is the Dean's Administrative Files and Supplemental Administrative Records. Each of these has been further divided, reflecting file orders maintained by the office itself. The Relations with other University Units series as well as the Personal series are relatively straightforward files.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>The Dean's Administrative Records, 1916-1960, represents records created by the dean's office in the course of administering the school. It has been divided into two subseries: Alphabetical and Chronological. Alphabetical, 1916-59 (primarily 1924-44) represents papers inherited by Stevenson from his predecessors, deans Day and Griffin. The papers cover a wide variety of topics, but usually in an incomplete manner. Major topics addressed include alumni, faculty and staff, scholarships and fellowships, and students. In a few areas, such as annual reports (both of the dean and to the dean by faculty), and the school's facilities (buildings), Stevenson continued to file into this group of papers. For the most part, however, Stevenson created a separate file which was arranged alphabetically, but broken at regular chronological intervals. Thus the Dean's Administrative sub-series, Chronological, is divided into six units: 1944-48, 1949-51, 1951-53, 1954-July 1956, 1956-1959, and 1959-60. The Chronological file tends to be rather narrowly focused on Stevenson himself, and does not give a broader view of activities within the school.</p>

            <p>Supplemental Administrative Records are largely documents generated by individuals other than the dean or his immediate staff that found their way into the dean's office, either by way of reference or for safekeeping. The Supplemental Administrative Records are divided into two subseries, Programs for Full-Time Students and Faculty and Programs for Special Groups. Programs for Full-Time Students and Faculty, 1924-60, details information about activities designed as part of the school's specific functions as an institution for higher learning. Primarily this means activities related to the school's degree granting activities, although information regarding the administration of the bureaus is also filed here. Prominently mentioned are the Business Research Bureau, Courses, the Curriculum Committee, the Executive Committee, the Hospital Administration Program, and the Bureau of Industrial Relations.</p>
            <p>Programs for Special Groups documents the many special presentations the school organized. The GSBA has maintained a strong tradition of serving private groups by organizing special lectures, seminars, short courses and other activities not intended to lead toward any degree but rather designed to update practitioners in a particular area of business with current academic research. Dating from 1932 to 1960, and arranged chronologically, Programs for Special Groups' records particularly document areas such as the annual alumni conference, real estate, accounting, public utilities administration, and bank management.</p>

              <p>The first sub-series, Senior Administrators/Centralized Functions, dates from 1923 to 1960 and includes records relating to university non-teaching units. Included is correspondence with the regents, the university's most important administrators, such as the president and vice-presidents, as well as communications with units such as the General Library and the Registrar's office. The records are arranged alphabetically, generally by title of office, but some filing irregularities exist. For example, correspondence with Vice-Presidents Briggs, Niehuss and Pierpont is filed under "v", while correspondence with Vice-President Smith is filed under "s".</p>

              <p>Schools, Colleges, Departments and Similar Divisions also date from 1923 to 1960. As the name implies, records found here largely deal with the various teaching units of the university. Filing is again alphabetical, generally by name of unit, but some subject headings, such as "Combined Curriculum" exist. Subject headings often include correspondence with units that also have an independent heading. For example, under "Combined Curriculum" a folder titled "Business and Law" is found while later in the file "Law School" is also found.</p>

            <p>The Personal series, dating from 1926 to 1960, contains the personal papers which Dean Stevenson left at the school. They are divided into two sub-series, General, and Lear, Inc. The General papers, 1926-60, are arranged alphabetically and contain a wide variety of information. There are records Stevenson brought from Minnesota, information regarding his negotiations to come to Michigan as dean, and an extensive run of "publications" that includes both printed material and speeches. Stevenson served on the board of various corporations, but the best documented is that of Lear, Inc. Stevenson's board records date from 1951 to 1960 and represent not only documents sent to him as a board member, but also his activity on committees dealing with special compensation to be paid both to the firm's most senior executives as well as to the general work force.</p>

          <p>The Bond subgroup is largely composed of records generated during Bond's years as dean, 1960-79, although a few items created by his successor, Gilbert Whitaker, and predecessors are also housed here, making the series full dates 1926-1984. The basic arrangement of the subgroup mirrors that of Dean Stevenson, as it contains series entitled Dean's Administrative Records, Supplemental Administrative Records, Relations with other University Units, and Personal; it also includes two additional series: Audio Materials and Publications.</p>

            <p>Bond maintained a large Dean's Administrative file dating from 1926 to 1983 (primarily 1960-79) that is arranged alphabetically, generally by either personal name or subject heading. Included is information regarding accreditation of the school, affirmative action, alumni, annual reports (of the dean to the president), Bond's correspondence and memos, detailed budget information, Dearborn campus, enrollment, facilities, fundraising, publications, memos to and from assistants such as Associate Dean Robert Roberts, students, and a few files created by Gilbert Whitaker. Taken together, these files are perhaps the single most informative source of information regarding the school contained within the collection.</p>

            <p>The school's Supplemental Administrative Records, are similar to those found in the Stevenson series, but in the Bond series they are arranged in a more complex manner, reflecting the school's growing administrative sophistication. There are four subseries: Committees, Faculty and Administrative Staff, Programs for Full-Time Faculty and Administrative Staff and Programs for Special Groups.</p>

              <p>Committees, 1951-81 (primarily 1961-78), is an alphabetical file of records mostly created by the school's many faculty committees. Most interesting are the Academic and Admissions, Curriculum, Doctoral Studies, Executive, and Visiting Committees. For reasons of confidentiality records of the Academic and Admissions committee, which passed upon all applications for admission, as well as on the fate of students who failed to maintain an acceptable grade point average, have been modified by the Bentley Library to mask the names of individual students. Despite this modification, it is usually possible to determine both the gender and race of applicants and students.</p>

              <p>Faculty and Administrative Staff have been further sub-divided into Administrative Staff, generally non-teaching personnel, and Faculty, generally teachers. Both divisions are arranged alphabetically. The Administrative Staff (1963-78) records include minutes of meetings as well as associated memos, position descriptions that resulted from the reclassification of many professional and administrative level personnel and retreats and conferences. Faculty (1959-79) records include meeting minutes (as well as an index), memos to the faculty (primarily written by Dean Bond), and faculty service records.</p>

              <p>Programs for Full-Time Students and Faculty (1960-82) is arranged alphabetically by subject and replicates in content the similarly titled file in the Stevenson series. However, filing distinctions during the Bond years became somewhat less clear and consequently the division between the regular academic program and the various special programs is not as sharp. Major topics found in this file include, Awards, BA Courses, Bureau of Industrial Relations, Division of Management Education, Doctoral Programs, Human Resources Accounting, Masters of Business Administration, and the McInally Lecture.</p>

            <p>The Personal series (1944-84) documents Bond's activities beyond the University of Michigan. Most notable are the papers Bond retained from his involvement with the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business. There is also information from the Economic Club of Detroit, the Committee for Economic Development (including records from Bond's trip to the Soviet Union), the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, the Educational Testing Service, and the Michigan Council on Economic Education.</p>

          <p>The Gilbert A. Whitaker Files subgroup (received as the 1993 Accession) spans the years 1925 to 1991; most of the material covers the period of Whitaker's tenure as dean, 1979 and 1990. The subgroup is divided into three series: Committees, Topical files, and Visual Material.</p>

            <p>The Committees series (1.6 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically by committee title. The series documents administrative decision-making at the school: the development of policy regarding curriculum, hiring practices, and relations with the business community. The "Committee Roles and Responsibilities" folder provides a succinct overview of each committee's purpose and organizational role, while the "Visiting Committee" files serve as an annual summary of changes and developments at the school from 1979 to 1988.</p>
            <p>Some "Executive Committee" files will remain closed for thirty years from their date of creation, because they contain confidential personnel information; "Faculty Meeting Minutes" created between 1928 and 1949 have been closed for 75 years, to protect students' confidentiality. The files for these committees which remain open, however, provide insight into decision-making processes at the school.</p>
            <p>Faculty Meeting Minutes from the 1920s, and Curriculum Committee Minutes created between 1947 and 1961, supplement earlier accessions from the Stevenson and Bond administrations.</p>

            <p>The Topical files series (2.6 linear feet) is arranged alphabetically by subject, and covers the years 1962 to 1991 (bulk dates: 1978-1989). The series contains information on a wide variety of topics, from budgets and endowment data to sabbatical reports and curriculum assessments; the latter are listed by academic department or degree title, for example "Accounting", or "BBA".</p>
            <p>The "Faculty Retreat" files are of particular interest, as they include reports from faculty work groups which contain assessments of the school's effectiveness, as well as discussions of long-term planning and goals.</p>
            <p>The "AIESEC" [International Association of Students in Economics and Business Management] and "Student Council Minutes" files document aspects of student activities at the school.</p>
            <p>Files pertaining to Gilbert R Whitaker, Jr.'s deanship document the School of Business Administration during the mid-1980s. The "Whitaker -Five Year Plans/Goals Discussion Paper" contains Whitaker's assessment of the school's strengths and weaknesses, along with his long-term plans to promote the school's quality and reputation.</p>

            <p>The <title render="italic">Dividend Magazine</title> series is divided into two subseries: Negatives and Proofs, and Photographs. The two subseries have some overlap in the material they contain, but each includes some unique material as well. The majority of the material in the Negatives and Proofs subseries is from 1973-1978, and documents student life, faculty, classroom activities, various lecture series, Dean Bond, and the construction of Paton Accounting Center. There is also some material documenting women and African Americans at the school, as well as Gerald Ford's visit to the school in 1977.</p>
            <p>The Photographs subseries contains material primarily from 1977 to 1989. In addition to documenting many of the same types of people and activities as the negatives and proofs do, the photographs also show the construction of the Business Administration Library and some of the activities of Dean Whitaker.</p>
