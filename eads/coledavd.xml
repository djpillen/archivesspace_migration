      <p>David E. Cole was a student at the University of Michigan, receiving a B.S.M.E. and Mathematics in 1960, a M.S.M.E. in 1961 and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 1966. He became an Instructor of Mechanical Engineering in 1965, an Assistant Professor from 1966-1971 and an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics in 1971. In 1978, Cole became the Director for the Office of Automotive Transportation (OSAT). He was appointed a research scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in1991. While at the University of Michigan, Cole organized the annual Traverse City Management Briefing Seminar and was involved in the Joint U.S.-Japan Automotive Study. Cole retired from active faculty status in 2000. Soon after his retirement, Cole became a Management Partner of the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM), which changed its name to Altarum in 2001. Cole took the position of the Chairman of the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), which was associated with Altarum. In 2003, CAR left Altarum to become a stand-alone non-profit.</p>
      <p>An active member of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Cole was made an SAE fellow in 1986. He was a member of the SAE Board of Directors from 1980-1983 and 1985-1988. Cole served on various boards and committees within the SAE, including the Engineering Activity Board. In addition, Cole was the Technical Program Chairman for the 1988 FISTIA Conference. Cole was active in other professional organizations, and became fellow of the Engineering Society of Detroit (ESD) in 1990. In 2000, Cole received their highest award, the Horace H. Rackham medal. He was a member of the Air Pollution Control Association and the Society of Automotive Analysts. In addition, Cole was on the Board of Directors for the French-American Business Association and was the Chairman for the Automotive Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>Cole did consulting work for numerous companies and government agencies. According to a 1992 email recommending Cole for the medal of the French Order of Merit, he was a consultant in the areas of "vehicle design, internal combustion engines (emphasis on exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency) and strategic automotive industry issues." His many professional roles included the position of Chairman of Environmental Dynamics Inc. and also of the Automotive Consulting Group. Cole was President of Applied Theory Inc., a member of Johnson Controls Technical Advisory Group and of the Allied Corporation Automotive Technology Council, and a board member of Aero Detroit /Auto Dynamics. He was the Director of the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. Cole was also involved in the establishment of five Ann Arbor-based companies.</p>
      <p>In his work for the United States Government, Cole served on the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Pact Select Panel, the Energy Engineering Board of the National Research Council and the NASA Space Systems and Technical Advisory Committee. He was a member of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and was "appointed by Michigan's Governor to the Michigan Technology Tri-Corridor Steering Committee" (Biographical Profile from the University of Michigan). He also served on the Michigan Technology Council, the Economic Development Education Committee and the Michigan Environmental Review Board.</p>
      <p>According to the SAE 1981 Ballot for Election of Officers, Cole's research interests included "mixture-motion effects on spark-ignited engine combustion, the development of thermal reactors for emission control, the development and testing of rotary and reciprocating spark-ignition engines, the photographic studies of flames, the optical measurements of both dynamic and thermal phenomena, the influence of vehicle maintenance and engine modifications on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption, automotive coolant evaluation and studies of stratified-charge engines." He also did research on the Wankel engine and studied manufacturer-supplier relationships. Later in his career, Cole focused on "strategic issues related to the restructuring of the North American industry and trends in globalization, technology, market factors, and human resource requirements," according to his biographical profile from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>Over his professional career, Cole received numerous awards. In addition to the Horace H. Rackham medal, Cole was awarded the National Automobile Dealers Association Foundation's International Freedom of Mobility Award. He received Sweden's Order of the Polar Star in 1994 and was selected by Design News as an engineering leader. In 1998, Cole was named Marketing Educator of the Year by the Society of Marketing Executives and received the Rene Dubos Environmental Award. He received the National Order of Merit from France in 1999.</p>

              <p>The Clean Air Car Race was a race from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to the California Institute of Technology, with the goal to increase public awareness of efforts to create low pollution vehicles. Winners of the contest were determined by a combination of performance, safety, low emissions and time. University of Michigan students entered two cars, a 1970 Volkswagen and a 1970 Chevelle, to compete in the internal combustion category. Cole's involvement in the project included overseeing student activities.</p>

            <scopecontent>
              <p>The Urban Vehicle Design Competition (UVDC) was a student-organized contest to design and build a vehicle suitable for use in urban environments. The contest was open to students from U.S. and Canadian universities, and involved roughly 2500 students from 84 universities. Vehicle design goals included creating a car that would handle traffic well in urban areas, but that would also improve exhaust emissions, passenger safety, parkability, energy efficiency and low speed impact protection. The competition was an outgrowth of the 1970 Clean Air Car Race, and was sponsored by SCORE (Student Competition on Relevant Engineering). The University of Michigan contributed two entries designed by students in the ME 498 course taught by Professor Cole, the Urban Car 1000 and 1100. The Urban Car 1000 was a rear-engine, rear-drive car, while the Urban Car 1100 was front-engine, front-drive. This subseries includes vehicle drawings and blueprints.</p>

              <p>The U.S.-Japan Automotive Project subseries contains information on the Joint U.S.-Japan Automotive Study and the International Automotive Industry Forum. The Joint U.S.-Japan Automotive Study was formed in 1981 in response to U.S. demand for information on the Japanese automotive industry. The University of Michigan partnered with Technova (who was the primary supporter and sponsor of the study) to do research on technologies, practices, policies and relationship between manufacturers and suppliers of the automotive industry in both countries. The Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Michigan served as the U.S. Secretariat, while Technova filled this same position for Japan. This study resulted in a comprehensive report written in 1984. During this period, the University of Michigan held several US-Japan Automotive Industry Conferences (later called the International Automotive Industry Conference), where David Cole served on the Planning Committee. The Joint U.S.-Japan Automotive Study led to the formation of the International Automotive Industry Forum, which was established to promote "a continuing dialogue among major institutional participants in the Japanese and U.S. auto industry" and to "identify and clarify the major emergent issues confronting and leading to a restructuring of the world auto industry" (Statement on the International Auto Industry Forum, 1985). Another reason for the creation of the forum was to monitor the development of the industry in relation to the U.S.-Japan Automotive Study's final report. This subseries includes reports, information on meetings, and materials from the International Automotive Industry Forums.</p>

            <p>This subseries documents three government projects: the Cooperative Automotive Research Program (CARP), the U.S.-Canada Automotive Select Panel and the Auto-in-Michigan (AIM) Project. CARP was a program supported by the government and automotive industry that sponsored automotive projects in 12 major research areas. Cole was the Chairman of the Engine/Fuel and Thermal/Fluid Sciences Advisory Panel. This subseries contains meeting materials and correspondence from that project. Cole was a member of the U.S.-Canada Automotive Select Panel and was involved in the Competitiveness Subcommittee. Materials on this panel include correspondence, meeting minutes and preliminary proposal from OSAT. The Auto-in-Michigan (AIM) Project was created to "target the changing automotive sector with focused economic development programs" (AIM Interim Report). Cole served on the Central Research Team. Included in this subseries are reports from this project.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence series contains correspondence written and received by Cole during his affiliation with the University of Michigan. The series is arranged into two subseries by chronological and alphabetical order. The chronological subseries dates from 1979 to 2000 and contains correspondence from Cole's time as the Director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation (OSAT). This correspondence covers a variety of subjects concerning OSAT, such as automotive projects, seminars (including the Traverse City Management Briefing Seminar), staffing/employment, funding and automotive issues and research. The alphabetical subseries is arranged by last name or company and is divided into two groups by date, which is how the subseries was originally arranged. It seems that this subseries focuses more on Cole's professional activities outside of OSAT. Correspondence can be found throughout the collection within other series.</p>

          <p>The Research series documents Cole's consulting work and research activities. The Consulting subseries contains information on Cole's consulting work for various companies. Cole provided consulting services for Bendix as part of their Technical Advisory Board. He was a member of the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group (CPC) Supplier Council Joint Committee and also their College of Engineering Board. This subseries is separate from the Company Files because this division reflects the original arrangement of the collection. The Conference and Seminars subseries documents events that Cole attended or helped to plan. For more documentation on conferences, please see the Speaking Engagements series. Cole's research interests included the Wankel engine, which was an internal combustion engine with a rotary design invented by German engineer Felix Wankel. The Wankel Engine subseries contains correspondence, reports, publications and clippings, and information on the 1972 Wankel Engine Seminar in Traverse City.</p>
